# ClawStart Sales Pipeline System
## Implement Today. Close This Week.

This is your complete pipeline system — stages, templates, scoring, CRM setup, follow-up cadences, weekly rhythm, and KPIs. No theory. Just systems.

---

# SECTION 1: PIPELINE STAGES (Detailed)

## Stage 1: PROSPECTING

**Definition:** Research, list building, and pre-call preparation. You're identifying WHO to contact and WHY.

**Entry Criteria:** Lead appears on a prospect list (from playbook, referral, website traffic, LinkedIn research, or local business directory).

**Exit Criteria:** You have a name, phone number/email, specific pain point hypothesis, and a reason to call. Lead moves to "First Contact."

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Identify prospect from target list or inbound signal
- [ ] Complete pre-call research checklist (see Sales Training Manual)
- [ ] Find decision maker name and direct contact info
- [ ] Write 1-sentence pain point hypothesis
- [ ] Assign lead score (see Section 3)
- [ ] Add to CRM with all fields populated

**Time Limit:** 10 minutes max per prospect. Don't over-research. Action beats information.

**Template — Prospect Research Notes:**
```
Company: _______________
Decision Maker: _______________ Title: _______________
Phone: _______________ Email: _______________
Website: _______________
Industry/Vertical: _______________
Team Size (est.): _______________
Pain Point Hypothesis: _______________
Trigger Event (why now): _______________
Notes from research: _______________

```

## Stage 2: FIRST CONTACT

**Definition:** You've reached out — cold call, cold email, LinkedIn message, or any combination. Goal is to book a discovery call.

**Entry Criteria:** First outreach attempt made. Lead is in CRM with a contact record.

**Exit Criteria:** Discovery call booked (move to Stage 3) OR lead is disqualified/unresponsive after full cadence (move to nurture or archive).

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Make first call attempt (log outcome)
- [ ] Send cold email if no answer (use vertical-specific template from playbook)
- [ ] Connect on LinkedIn with personalized note
- [ ] Follow the 7-touch cadence (see Section 5)
- [ ] Log every touchpoint in CRM
- [ ] If conversation happens: qualify with 2-3 questions, pitch the discovery call

**Time Limit:** 30 days for full cadence. If no response after 7 touches over 30 days, move to "Nurture" list for quarterly re-engagement.

**Template — First Contact Email (Generic):**
```
Subject: Quick question about [Company Name]

Hi [Name],

I help [industry] businesses in [city/region] automate their operations —
specifically the stuff that eats up 15-20 hours a week: lead follow-up,
scheduling, client communication, CRM updates.

Most [industry] owners I talk to are losing [$X/month] to missed [leads/calls/follow-ups].

Worth a 15-minute conversation to see if we can fix that?

[Your Name]
ClawStart | [phone]
```

---

## Stage 3: DISCOVERY BOOKED

**Definition:** Discovery call is scheduled. Now you prepare.

**Entry Criteria:** Prospect has confirmed a specific date/time for a discovery call.

**Exit Criteria:** Discovery call completed (move to Stage 4).

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Send confirmation email immediately (see template below)
- [ ] Send calendar invite with Zoom/phone details
- [ ] Complete deep research on prospect (10-15 min)
- [ ] Prepare 3 custom ROI scenarios for their business
- [ ] Prepare industry-specific demo environment
- [ ] Review the Discovery Call Blueprint (Sales Training Manual)
- [ ] Send reminder 24 hours before: "Looking forward to our call tomorrow at [time]! Let me know if anything's changed."
- [ ] Send reminder 1 hour before (text): "Hey [Name], looking forward to chatting in an hour. Talk soon!"

**Time Limit:** Discovery call should happen within 5 business days of booking. Longer = colder.

**Template — Confirmation Email:**
```
Subject: Confirmed: ClawStart Discovery Call — [Date] at [Time]

Hey [Name],

We're all set for [Date] at [Time] [timezone].

Here's the Zoom link: [link]
(Or I'll call you at [their number] — your preference.)

I'll keep it focused — my goal is to learn about [Company Name]'s
operations and show you exactly how other [industry] businesses are
saving 15-20 hours/week with AI-powered automation.

To make the most of our time, it'd help to know:
- What's your biggest operational headache right now?
- How many people are on your team?

No homework required — just want to make sure I'm relevant.

Talk soon,
[Your Name]
```

## Stage 4: DISCOVERY COMPLETE

**Definition:** Discovery call happened. You now have deep knowledge of their situation, pain, and fit.

**Entry Criteria:** Discovery call completed and notes documented.

**Exit Criteria:** Proposal sent (move to Stage 5) OR prospect disqualified (move to Nurture or Closed Lost).

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Complete discovery notes template within 1 hour of call
- [ ] Score prospect using qualification scorecard
- [ ] If qualified: prepare custom proposal within 24 hours
- [ ] If closed on call: skip to Stage 7 (Closed Won)
- [ ] If not qualified: move to nurture with reason documented
- [ ] Send thank you email within 2 hours with key takeaways

**Time Limit:** Proposal must be sent within 48 hours of discovery call. Momentum is everything.

---

## Stage 5: PROPOSAL SENT

**Definition:** You've sent a formal proposal with pricing. The ball is in their court (but you're still driving).

**Entry Criteria:** Custom proposal delivered to prospect.

**Exit Criteria:** Prospect accepts (Stage 7) OR enters negotiation (Stage 6) OR declines (Stage 8).

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Send proposal via email with a personal note (not just an attachment)
- [ ] Walk them through the proposal LIVE if possible (screen share or in person)
- [ ] Follow the post-proposal cadence (see Section 5)
- [ ] Prepare for objections (review Objection Handling Playbook)
- [ ] If no response in 48 hours: follow up with call
- [ ] If no response in 7 days: send value-add + check in

**Time Limit:** Proposals should close within 14 days. After 14 days, urgency is dying.

**Template — Proposal Email:**
```
Subject: [Company Name] × ClawStart — Your Custom Proposal

Hey [Name],

Loved our conversation on [day]. Based on what you shared, I put together
a proposal that maps to exactly what [Company Name] needs.

Here's the quick summary:
- Problem: [Their top 2 pain points in their words]
- Solution: ClawStart [plan] — [1-sentence description]
- Investment: $[amount] setup + $[amount]/month
- ROI: $[amount]/year (based on [their specific numbers])
- Timeline: Live in 2 weeks from kickoff

Full proposal attached. I'd love to walk you through it live — can we
do 15 minutes on [specific day/time]?

If everything looks good and you're ready to go, here's the link to
get started: [payment/agreement link]

Talk soon,
[Your Name]
```

**What to Include in the Proposal:**
1. Their situation (mirror their own words back)
2. The problem and what it's costing them
3. The ClawStart solution (specific to their use case)
4. What's included (setup, customization, integrations, managed care)
5. ROI calculation with their numbers
6. Investment (setup + monthly)
7. Timeline (kickoff to live)
8. Social proof (testimonial or case study)
9. Next steps (clear CTA)

**Presenting Price — The Right Way:**
1. Always present Enterprise ($15K) first, then Growth ($5K). Anchoring makes Growth feel like a deal.
2. Never say "cost" or "price." Say "investment."
3. Present in context of ROI: "The investment is $8K in year one. Based on your numbers, the return is $[X]. That's a [X]x ROI."
4. Offer the payment plan proactively: "$5,000 for setup — or $2,500 now and $2,500 in 30 days."
5. Then STOP TALKING. Let them respond.

---

## Stage 6: NEGOTIATION

**Definition:** They want to move forward but are pushing back on terms, price, scope, or timeline.

**Entry Criteria:** Prospect has responded to proposal with questions, requests for changes, or price pushback.

**Exit Criteria:** Agreement reached (Stage 7) OR deal lost (Stage 8).

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Listen to their specific concerns (don't assume)
- [ ] Identify what they actually want changed vs. what's a negotiating tactic
- [ ] Respond within 24 hours to every negotiation touchpoint
- [ ] Use the flexibility guide below
- [ ] Get everything agreed upon in writing

**Time Limit:** Negotiations shouldn't exceed 7 days. If they're dragging, something else is going on — uncover it.

**What You CAN Flex On:**
- Payment terms (split payments, net 30 on second half)
- Onboarding timeline (delay start date if they need time)
- Scope of initial setup (start smaller, add later)
- Additional training sessions for their team
- Extended pilot period (7 days → 14 days for Enterprise)
- Annual contract discount (15% off monthly if paid yearly)

**What You CANNOT Flex On:**
- Setup fee below $4,000 (Growth) or $12,000 (Enterprise) — hold the line
- Monthly managed care fee — this is your recurring revenue, protect it
- Scope creep without price adjustment — more integrations = more money
- Free work as a "test" — free pilots are structured (see Competitive Edge Playbook)
- Your team's time boundaries — don't let negotiations eat your selling hours

**If they ask for a discount:**
*"I appreciate you asking. The price reflects the value — and we've built the ROI case that shows [X]x return. What I can do is offer a payment plan to make it easier on cash flow: $2,500 now, $2,500 in 30 days. Or if you commit to an annual contract on the monthly service, I can do 15% off — that's $212/month instead of $250. Which of those works better?"*

## Stage 7: CLOSED WON 🎉

**Definition:** They said yes. Agreement signed. Payment received (or scheduled).

**Entry Criteria:** Signed agreement + first payment received.

**Exit Criteria:** Client handed off to onboarding. (This stage is a brief handoff, not a resting place.)

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Send "Welcome to ClawStart" email (template below)
- [ ] Process payment
- [ ] Create client folder (shared Google Drive or equivalent)
- [ ] Schedule kickoff call within 5 business days
- [ ] Assign onboarding team member
- [ ] Update CRM: mark as Closed Won, log deal value, close date
- [ ] Celebrate! (seriously — ring a bell, send a team message, do something)
- [ ] Ask for referral at 30-day mark (see Section 5)

**Time Limit:** Kickoff call within 5 business days of closing. Don't let new clients cool off.

**Template — Welcome Email:**
```
Subject: Welcome to ClawStart! 🚀 Here's What Happens Next

## Stage 8: CLOSED LOST

**Definition:** They said no (for now). But "no" often means "not yet."

**Entry Criteria:** Prospect explicitly declined OR went completely unresponsive after full follow-up cadence.

- [ ] Review: what could you have done differently? Log learnings.

## Revenue Modeling: What Does Growth Look Like?

### Scenario 1: 2 Clients/Month (Startup Phase)
- Setup revenue: $10,000-$30,000/month
- New MRR: $500-$1,500
- After 6 months: 12 clients × $250/mo = $3,000 MRR + setup revenue
- **Annual run rate: $120,000-$360,000 (setup) + $36,000 (recurring)**

### Scenario 2: 5 Clients/Month (Growth Phase)
- Setup revenue: $25,000-$75,000/month
- New MRR: $1,250-$3,750
- After 6 months: 30 clients × $250/mo = $7,500 MRR + setup revenue
- **Annual run rate: $300,000-$900,000 (setup) + $90,000 (recurring)**

### Scenario 3: 10 Clients/Month (Scale Phase)
- Setup revenue: $50,000-$150,000/month
- New MRR: $2,500-$7,500
- After 6 months: 60 clients × $250/mo = $15,000 MRR + setup revenue
- **Annual run rate: $600,000-$1,800,000 (setup) + $180,000 (recurring)**

### The MRR Snowball

This is the beautiful part of the model. Every client adds recurring revenue that never stops:

| Month | New Clients | Total Clients | Monthly Setup Rev | MRR | Total Monthly Rev |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | 2 | $10,000 | $500 | $10,500 |
| 2 | 2 | 4 | $10,000 | $1,000 | $11,000 |
| 3 | 3 | 7 | $15,000 | $1,750 | $16,750 |
| 4 | 3 | 10 | $15,000 | $2,500 | $17,500 |
| 5 | 4 | 14 | $20,000 | $3,500 | $23,500 |
| 6 | 5 | 19 | $25,000 | $4,750 | $29,750 |
| **6-Mo Total** | **19** | **19** | **$95,000** | **$4,750/mo** | **$109,000** |

By month 12, if you've signed 40+ clients, you're looking at $10,000+/month in MRR alone — that's $120K/year in pure recurring revenue, on top of setup fees.

**This is how you build a million-dollar business in 18 months.**
