# SECTION 1: MINDSET & POSITIONING

## You Are NOT Selling Software

Get this tattooed on your brain: **you are selling time back and revenue gained.**

When you pick up the phone, you're not calling to pitch a product. You're calling because the person on the other end is:
- Missing calls at 11 PM that are worth $3,000
- Spending 15 hours/week on tasks a machine can do
- Losing clients because follow-up falls through the cracks
- Paying $45,000/year for an admin who still can't work weekends

You are the person who fixes that. You are the consultant. You are the expert. You walked in with the solution before they even knew they had the problem.

**Vendor vs. Consultant — Know the Difference:**

| Vendor Mindset | Consultant Mindset |
|---|---|
| "Let me tell you about our features" | "Tell me about your biggest bottleneck" |
| "Our price is $5,000" | "This saves you $16K/year — the investment is $5K" |
| "Can I send you a brochure?" | "Let me show you exactly how this works for YOUR business" |
| "I hope you'll consider us" | "Based on what you've told me, here's what I recommend" |
| Asks for permission | Assumes authority |
| Follows up meekly | Follows up with value |

## Tony Robbins Psychology of Selling

CD, you know this framework. Now we apply it to every sales conversation.

### State Management — Before Every Call

Your state determines your outcome. Period. Before you dial:

1. **Physiology first.** Stand up. Shoulders back. Smile (they can hear it). Take 3 deep breaths. Move your body — jump, clap, do 10 pushups. You cannot close from a slumped position.
2. **Focus.** Ask yourself: "What am I grateful for right now?" Then: "How can I serve this person today?" You're not calling to take — you're calling to give.
3. **Incantations, not affirmations.** Say it with your body: "I am the best at what I do. I deliver massive value. Every call I make changes someone's business." Feel it. Mean it.
4. **Peak state trigger.** Find your anchor — a song, a memory, a physical gesture. Use it before every power dial block. Consistency creates certainty.

### The Six Human Needs in Sales

Every prospect is driven by these. Identify which ones dominate and speak to them:

1. **Certainty** — "This is proven. Here's exactly what happens. Here are businesses like yours already using it."
2. **Variety/Uncertainty** — "Imagine what becomes possible when you're not stuck doing the same admin every day."
3. **Significance** — "You'd be the first firm in your area running AI operations. Your competitors won't know what hit them."
4. **Connection/Love** — "Your clients will feel like they have a dedicated team working for them 24/7."
5. **Growth** — "This frees you to focus on what actually grows the business — the high-level work only you can do."
6. **Contribution** — "Think about what your team could accomplish if they weren't buried in busywork."

**Pro tip:** Listen for which needs they express in the first 2 minutes. A dentist worried about missed calls = certainty + significance. An agency owner buried in delivery = growth + variety. Mirror their need back.

### Asking Quality Questions

Robbins says: "Successful people ask better questions." In sales, the person asking questions controls the conversation.

**Rules:**
- Never ask a question you don't know the answer to (strategically)
- Ask questions that make them feel the pain of inaction
- Ask questions that make them visualize the solution
- Ask questions where the answer sells for you

**Power Questions:**
- "What would it mean for your business if every lead got a response in under 5 minutes?"
- "If I could give you back 15 hours a week, what would you do with that time?"
- "What's it costing you RIGHT NOW to not have this solved?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how frustrated is your team with [specific pain]?"
- "What happens if nothing changes in the next 6 months?"

### Creating Certainty

People buy when they feel certain. Your job is to eliminate uncertainty at every stage:

- **Social proof:** "We work with brokerages/firms/practices like yours across the Front Range."
- **Specificity:** Don't say "it saves time." Say "it saves 15-20 hours per week on average."
- **Demonstration:** Show, don't tell. Live demos > slide decks. Every time.
- **Risk reversal:** "If you don't see ROI in 90 days, we'll work with you until you do."
- **Conviction:** If YOU aren't certain, they won't be. Know your product. Know your numbers. Know your value.

# SECTION 2: COLD CALLING MASTERY

## Pre-Call Research Checklist (5 minutes max)

Before you dial, pull up:

- [ ] **Company website** — What do they do? How big are they? Any recent news?
- [ ] **LinkedIn** — Who's the decision maker? What have they posted recently? Mutual connections?
- [ ] **Google Reviews** — What do their customers say? Any complaints about responsiveness or communication? (GOLD for your pitch)
- [ ] **Their tech stack** — Do they mention tools on their site? Job postings reveal what software they use
- [ ] **Recent hires** — Hiring for admin/receptionist/office manager? They have the pain you solve
- [ ] **Competitors** — Are similar businesses in their area more responsive/digital? Competitive pressure
- [ ] **Personal detail** — Anything from LinkedIn or bio you can reference to build rapport

**Write down ONE specific pain point you'll lead with based on this research.**

## The First 10 Seconds — Don't Get Hung Up On

You have 10 seconds. That's it. Here's what happens in those 10 seconds:

**Second 1-3:** They decide if you're a telemarketer (hang up) or a real person (keep listening)
**Second 4-7:** They decide if this is relevant to them
**Second 8-10:** They decide if they'll give you 30 more seconds

### What KILLS you in the first 10 seconds:
- "Hi, my name is ___ and I'm calling from ___" (telemarketer script — instant tune-out)
- Speaking too fast (nervous energy = low status)
- Speaking too slow (boring = hang up)
- Asking "How are you today?" (strangers don't ask that — salespeople do)
- Starting with features or company description

### What WINS in the first 10 seconds:
- **Pattern interrupt** — Say something unexpected
- **Relevant hook** — Reference something specific to THEM
- **Confident tone** — Peer-to-peer, like you're calling a colleague
- **Brevity** — Get to the point. Respect their time.

### The Pattern Interrupt Technique

A pattern interrupt breaks the mental script your prospect has for "salesperson calling me." Their brain expects: "Hi I'm calling from X company and I'd love to tell you about..." When you break that pattern, they actually listen.

**Examples:**
- "Hey [Name], you're going to think this is a cold call — and honestly it kind of is — but I think you'll want to hear this. Got 30 seconds?"
- "[Name], quick question before you hang up on me — [insert pain-point question]?"
- "Hi [Name], we haven't met — I run a company that does [one-sentence value prop]. I'm calling because [specific reason related to their business]."
- "[Name], I was looking at [their company] online and noticed [specific observation]. Can I share a quick thought?"

## Opening Scripts by Vertical

### Real Estate

*"Hey [Name], this is [You] with ClawStart. I work with real estate offices along the Front Range — quick question: how many leads came in after hours last month that didn't get responded to until the next morning? ... [Let them answer] ... Yeah, that's exactly why I'm calling. We deploy AI assistants that respond to every lead in under 2 minutes, 24/7 — and most brokerages we work with are converting 15-20% more leads because of it. I'd love to show you how it works in a quick 15-minute call. What does your [day] look like?"*

### Law Firms

*"Hey [Name], this is [You] with ClawStart. Quick question — if your attorneys bill at [$X]/hour, what would it mean to recover 5 hours a week each that's currently going to scheduling, client updates, and CRM work? ... [Let them respond] ... That's exactly what we help firms do. We deploy an AI operations assistant that handles the admin work so attorneys can bill more hours. Most firms see the ROI in month one. Worth 15 minutes to explore?"*

### Dental/Medical

*"Hey [Name], this is [You] with ClawStart. Quick question — how many calls does your front desk miss during peak hours? ... [Let them answer] ... That's pretty common — most practices miss 30-40% of incoming calls, and each one could be a $1,500 patient. We set up AI assistants that answer every call, book appointments, and send reminders — 24/7. Practices we work with are capturing 5+ additional patients a month. Can I show you how in 15 minutes?"*

### Financial Advisors

*"Hey [Name], this is [You] with ClawStart. I work with financial advisors on the Front Range. Here's what I hear constantly — the #1 reason clients leave their advisor isn't performance, it's feeling forgotten between reviews. We deploy AI assistants that keep your clients engaged with personalized touchpoints year-round, plus handle meeting prep and CRM updates. Would 15 minutes be worth it to see how?"*

### Marketing Agencies

*"Hey [Name], this is [You] with ClawStart. I work with agencies in the Denver/Boulder area. Let me guess — you're so buried in client delivery that your own pipeline dried up three months ago? ... [Laugh, let them respond] ... Yeah, that's literally every agency owner I talk to. We deploy AI operations assistants that handle client comms, scheduling, and lead nurture so you can actually have a pipeline again. Quick 15-minute demo?"*

## Tonality Guide

**How you say it matters more than what you say.** Practice these:

| Tonality | When to Use | How It Sounds |
|---|---|---|
| **Curious/Interested** | Asking questions, discovery | Genuine curiosity, like you're fascinated by their business |
| **Concerned** | Addressing their pain | Slightly lower pitch, slower pace — "That sounds like it's costing you..." |
| **Confident/Matter-of-fact** | Presenting the solution | Steady, no uptick at end of sentences, no hedging language |
| **Playful/Light** | Pattern interrupts, rapport | Smile in your voice, slightly faster, relaxed |
| **Certain/Absolute** | Closing, handling objections | Firm, definitive — "Here's what I'd recommend." |
| **Peer-to-peer** | ALWAYS | You're an equal. Not below them (needy) or above them (arrogant) |

**Words to ELIMINATE:**
- "Just" — "I'm just calling to..." (minimizes you)
- "Honestly" — implies you're usually dishonest
- "Does that make sense?" — implies they might not understand
- "Sorry to bother you" — you're not sorry, you have value
- "I think" / "I believe" — say "Here's what I know" or "Here's what we see"
- "Cheap" / "Affordable" — say "investment" or "ROI"

**Words to USE:**
- "Specifically" — makes everything sound credible
- "Typically" — implies experience and track record
- "What we've found is..." — positions you as expert
- "Most [industry] owners/managers tell us..." — social proof
- "I'd recommend..." — consultant authority

## Gatekeeper Scripts

The receptionist or office manager is not your enemy. They are either a gateway or a dead end based on how you treat them.

### Script 1: The Confident Colleague
*"Hey! Is [Decision Maker Name] available? This is [Your Name]."*
(That's it. No company name. No explanation. Say it like you know them. 60% of the time, you get put through.)

### Script 2: The Referral Play
*"Hi, I'm hoping you can help me. I'm trying to reach the person who handles technology decisions for the practice/firm/office. Who would that be?"*
(Gets a name, even if they don't transfer you.)

### Script 3: The Ally
*"Hey [Gatekeeper Name], I totally get it — you're protecting [Boss Name]'s time, and I respect that. Here's the deal: I work with [similar businesses] to automate the stuff that buries office teams — scheduling, follow-ups, all that. If [Boss Name] saw what we do, they'd want to know about it. Can I get 2 minutes, or is there a better time to try?"*

### Script 4: For Office Managers (They ARE the Decision Maker)
*"Actually, you might be exactly who I need to talk to. Are you the one managing the day-to-day operations? ... [Yes] ... Perfect. I help offices like yours automate the communication and scheduling work that eats up your whole day. Got 5 minutes?"*

## Voicemail Scripts That Get Callbacks

**Rules for voicemails:**
- Under 30 seconds. Period.
- Leave a curiosity gap — don't explain everything
- Sound like a human, not a pitch
- End with your number TWICE (slowly)

### Script 1: The Curiosity Gap
*"Hey [Name], it's [You] — [phone number]. I was looking at [their company] and found something I think could save you [specific benefit]. Give me a call back at [phone number]. Talk soon."*

### Script 2: The Referral Tease
*"[Name], this is [You]. I was talking to another [industry] owner in [city] who mentioned you might be dealing with [common pain point]. I have an idea that could help. [Phone number]. That's [phone number]. Thanks."*

### Script 3: The Direct
*"[Name], [You] with ClawStart. We help [industry] businesses automate operations and typically save 15-20 hours a week. I'd love to show you how in 10 minutes. [Phone number]. Again, [phone number]."*

**Follow-up voicemail (2nd attempt, 3 days later):**
*"Hey [Name], [You] again — I left you a message [day]. I know you're busy, that's actually exactly why I'm calling. Quick 10 minutes — [phone number]."*

# SECTION 3: WARM LEAD SCRIPTS (Inbound/Website)

## Speed-to-Lead Framework

**The 5-Minute Rule: Call every inbound lead within 5 minutes.**

This is not optional. This is the single highest-ROI activity in your business.

- Leads called within 5 minutes: **21x more likely to qualify** (Harvard Business Review)
- Leads called within 30 minutes: 50% less likely to convert than 5-minute leads
- Leads called after 24 hours: Basically cold calls at that point

### How to implement:
1. Set up instant notifications (email + phone) when a lead comes in from the website
2. Whoever is on "lead duty" drops everything and calls within 5 minutes
3. If you can't call, send a personalized text/email within 2 minutes: *"Hey [Name], this is [You] from ClawStart. Just saw your inquiry — I'd love to chat. Got 10 minutes right now, or when's a good time?"*
4. Track your speed-to-lead. Measure it weekly. It's a KPI.

## Inbound Call Script

They came to YOU. The energy is different. You're not convincing — you're confirming.

*"Hey [Name]! Thanks for reaching out to ClawStart. I saw you [filled out the form / visited the site / etc.]. I'd love to learn more about your business and see if we can help. What prompted you to look into AI operations?"*

**Then LISTEN.** Let them talk. They'll tell you exactly what to sell them.

**After they explain their situation:**
*"That makes total sense. We work with a lot of [industry] businesses dealing with exactly that. Here's what typically works — [brief solution overview]. Would it be helpful if I showed you exactly how it would look for your business? I can do a quick demo right now, or we can schedule 20 minutes later this week."*

## Discovery Question Framework (SPIN Adapted for ClawStart)

SPIN = Situation, Problem, Implication, Need-Payoff. Adapted:

### Situation Questions (Understanding their world)
- "Walk me through a typical day at your office. What does the workflow look like?"
- "How many people are on your team? Who handles what?"
- "What tools/software are you currently using?"
- "How do leads/clients/patients currently reach you?"
- "What does your follow-up process look like today?"

### Problem Questions (Finding the pain)
- "What's the biggest bottleneck in your operations right now?"
- "Where do things fall through the cracks most often?"
- "What's the most frustrating part of your day-to-day?"
- "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about your office operations, what would it be?"
- "How many hours a week does your team spend on tasks that feel repetitive or low-value?"

### Implication Questions (Making the pain HURT)
- "When a lead doesn't get followed up within an hour, what usually happens to that lead?"
- "What does it cost you when a patient no-shows? How many times a week does that happen?"
- "If an attorney is spending 10 hours a week on non-billable admin, what's that in lost revenue annually?"
- "How does that bottleneck affect your ability to grow?"
- "What happens if nothing changes in the next 12 months?"

### Need-Payoff Questions (Let them sell themselves)
- "If every lead got a response in under 5 minutes, how would that impact your conversion rate?"
- "What would your team do with 15 extra hours a week?"
- "If you could reduce no-shows by 30-50%, what would that mean for your revenue?"
- "How would it change things if your CRM was always up to date — without anyone touching it?"
- "What would it mean for you personally to not be the bottleneck anymore?"

**The key:** After implication questions, PAUSE. Let the silence work. They need to feel the weight of the problem before you offer the solution.

## Demo Script

**Setup (before the demo):**
- Know their industry, pain points, and what they told you in discovery
- Have a demo environment ready that mirrors their vertical
- Have ROI numbers pre-calculated for their specific situation

**Demo Flow (15-20 minutes):**

**1. Recap & Confirm (2 min)**
*"[Name], last time we talked, you mentioned [pain point 1] and [pain point 2] were the biggest challenges. Is that still accurate? Anything else come up since we talked?"*

**2. Show, Don't Tell (10 min)**
*"Let me show you exactly how ClawStart handles this. Here's what happens when a [lead/patient/client] reaches out at 10 PM on a Tuesday..."*

Walk through 2-3 specific scenarios that map to THEIR pain:
- Show the AI handling an inbound inquiry
- Show automated scheduling/follow-up
- Show CRM updates happening automatically
- Show reporting/insights they'd get

**3. ROI Moment (3 min)**
*"So based on what you told me — [X leads/month, $Y average value, Z hours on admin] — here's what the math looks like..."*

Pull out the numbers. Be specific. Write it down if you're in person, share your screen if virtual.

**4. Future Paint (2 min)**
*"Imagine it's 90 days from now. Your [leads are converting 20% better / no-shows are cut in half / attorneys are billing 5 more hours a week]. Your team isn't drowning in admin. You're growing without adding headcount. That's what this looks like."*

**5. Transition to Close (3 min)**
*"So — does this make sense for [Company Name]? ... [Yes] ... Great. Here's what I'd recommend for you..."*

## Follow-Up Cadence After Demo

| Day | Action | Channel | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| Day 0 | Thank you + recap | Email | Summary of what you showed, ROI numbers, next steps |
| Day 1 | Check-in | Text/Call | "Hey [Name], any questions come up after our demo yesterday?" |
| Day 3 | Value-add | Email | Share a relevant case study or ROI calculator |
| Day 7 | Direct ask | Call | "Wanted to check in — are you ready to move forward, or is there anything holding you back?" |
| Day 14 | Urgency | Email | "Just helped [similar business] get started. Wanted to see if the timing works for you this month." |
| Day 30 | Re-engage | Email/Call | "Hey [Name], circling back. I know timing wasn't right last month — has anything changed? We have [X openings] for new setups this month." |

# SECTION 4: OBJECTION HANDLING PLAYBOOK

## The Psychology of Objections

**An objection is not a "no." It's a request for more information.**

When someone objects, they're telling you: "I'm interested enough to engage, but something is blocking me." Your job is to find the block and remove it.

**Rules:**
1. Never argue. Never get defensive.
2. Acknowledge the objection — make them feel heard
3. Ask a question to understand what's really going on
4. Reframe with the answer
5. Confirm the objection is resolved before moving on

### The "Feel, Felt, Found" Technique

*"I completely understand how you feel. Other [industry] owners felt the same way when they first heard about this. What they found was [reframe]."*

This works because it:
- Validates their emotion ("feel")
- Normalizes their concern ("felt" — others had it too)
- Provides social proof for the resolution ("found")

### The Isolation Technique

When you handle an objection, always isolate:

*"If we could solve [objection], is there anything else that would prevent us from moving forward?"*

This prevents the endless objection chain. If they say "no, that's it" — you only need to solve ONE thing. If they say "well, also..." — now you know ALL the objections and can address them together.

## The 20+ Objections with Exact Responses

### 1. "It's too expensive" / "We don't have the budget"

**Psychology:** They haven't connected the price to the value. Or they genuinely can't afford it right now.

**Response:**
*"I hear you — $5,000 is a real investment. Let me ask you this: you mentioned you're losing about [X leads/patients/hours] per [week/month]. What's that costing you? ... [Let them answer] ... So you're spending [higher number] on the problem every month. ClawStart costs $250/month after setup — that's less than a part-time admin for one day a week, and it works 24/7. Most of our clients see full ROI within the first 60 days. Would a payment plan help — $2,500 now and $2,500 in 30 days?"*

### 2. "We already have tools for that"

**Psychology:** They think you're a replacement for existing software. Fear of redundancy and waste.

**Response:**
*"That's great — what are you using? ... [Listen] ... Perfect. ClawStart doesn't replace any of that. It works WITH your tools. Think of it this way: you have the instruments, but nobody's playing them. ClawStart is the operator that actually uses your tools — responds to leads in your CRM, books appointments in your calendar, sends follow-ups through your email. It makes everything you already have actually work."*

### 3. "I have security/privacy concerns"

**Psychology:** Legitimate concern, especially in law, healthcare, finance. Also sometimes a smokescreen.

**Response:**
*"That's exactly the right question to ask — and honestly, it's a green flag that you're thinking about this. Here's how we handle it: all data is encrypted at rest and in transit. We work within your existing systems — we don't store your data separately. For [healthcare: we're HIPAA-compliant and sign BAAs / law: we sign NDAs and comply with attorney-client privilege requirements / finance: we maintain compliance-ready audit trails]. Your data is actually safer with automated systems than with human error — no sticky notes, no unlocked screens, no accidental forwards. Want me to walk you through the security architecture?"*

### 4. "I need to think about it"

**Psychology:** This is usually NOT about thinking. It's about uncertainty, fear of making the wrong decision, or an unspoken objection.

**Response (gentle isolation):**
*"Totally fair. Can I ask — what specifically do you want to think about? Is it the investment, the timing, or whether it would actually work for your business? ... [Let them answer] ... [Address the specific concern]. If I could answer that for you right now, would you be comfortable moving forward today?"*

**Alternative (Robbins-style — creating urgency through questions):**
*"I respect that. Let me ask you though — a month from now, will your [problem] be better or worse? ... [Worse] ... And every month you wait, you're spending [$ amount] on that problem. What if 30 days from now, instead of still thinking about it, you already had this running and your team was getting 15 hours a week back?"*

### 5. "I need to talk to my partner/spouse/board"

**Psychology:** Sometimes legitimate. Sometimes a polite stall. Either way, you need to arm them to sell it internally.

**Response:**
*"Absolutely — important decisions should involve the right people. Can I ask: are you personally sold on it? ... [If yes] ... Great. What I find works best is this — let me put together a one-page summary with the ROI numbers specific to your business. That way when you present it to [partner], you have everything you need. Also — would it make sense for me to jump on a quick call with both of you? I can answer any questions they have directly. What does [day] look like?"*

### 6. "We're too small for this"

**Psychology:** They think AI is for big companies. Insecurity about their size.

**Response:**
*"Actually, that's exactly who benefits the most. Big companies have armies of admins and operations teams. You're doing all of that with — what, you and two other people? This is literally designed for businesses like yours. $250/month gives you an operations team that never calls in sick. The smaller you are, the bigger the impact."*

### 7. "We're too busy right now"

**Psychology:** Ironic — they're too busy to solve the thing that's making them busy.

**Response:**
*"[Laugh gently] I hear that a lot — and honestly, that's the whole point. You're too busy because everything is manual. The setup takes 2 weeks and we handle 90% of it. You'll spend maybe 2-3 hours total during setup. And then you GET hours back every single week. The question isn't whether you have time to set this up — it's whether you can afford another 6 months of being this busy."*

### 8. "I don't trust AI"

**Psychology:** Fear of the unknown. Bad experiences with chatbots. Worried about AI going rogue.

**Response:**
*"I get it — there's a lot of hype and garbage out there. Here's the difference: most 'AI' you've seen is a chatbot that spits out generic answers. ClawStart is an operations system that follows YOUR processes, uses YOUR words, and operates within YOUR tools. Nothing goes out without being configured to your standards. And you can see everything it does — full transparency. Think of it less like 'AI' and more like a really good virtual assistant that follows your playbook perfectly, every time. Want me to show you a live example?"*

### 9. "What if it breaks?"

**Psychology:** Fear of dependency on technology. What happens when things go wrong.

**Response:**
*"Great question. Two things: First, the system has built-in monitoring — if anything goes off track, we catch it before it becomes a problem. Second, you have a dedicated support line. $250/month includes ongoing managed care — that means we monitor, maintain, and update your system. If something needs attention, we handle it. You're not on your own. Compare that to an employee who calls in sick with no notice — at least the AI tells you when it needs help."*

### 10. "Can't I just do this myself with ChatGPT?"

**Psychology:** The DIY objection. They think the tools are the same.

**Response:**
*"You could try — and a lot of people do. Here's what they find: ChatGPT is a conversation tool. It answers questions when you ask them. What you need is an operations system that proactively acts on your behalf — responds to leads, books appointments, updates your CRM, sends follow-ups — all without you prompting it. That's like saying 'I have Google, so I don't need an accountant.' The tool and the implementation are two very different things. We build, configure, and maintain the entire system. You'd spend 200+ hours trying to piece it together yourself — and it still wouldn't work the same way."*

### 11. "We tried AI before and it didn't work"

**Psychology:** Burned before. Skepticism from a bad experience.

**Response:**
*"What did you try? ... [Listen carefully] ... Yeah, I hear that a lot. Most AI tools are either chatbots that frustrate customers or generic tools that don't fit your workflow. ClawStart is different because we don't give you a tool — we build a system. It's customized to YOUR business, YOUR processes, YOUR language. And we manage it ongoing. The reason your last experience didn't work is probably because someone sold you software and walked away. We don't walk away — $250/month means we're your ongoing operations partner. Would you be open to seeing what 'done right' looks like?"*

### 12. "Send me an email"

**Psychology:** Polite dismissal. They want to get off the phone.

**Response (Option A — respect + hook):**
*"Happy to. But let me ask — if I send you an email, it's going to sit in your inbox with 200 others. What if instead, I send you a 2-minute video showing exactly what this looks like for a [their industry]? That way you can watch it when it's convenient and if it's interesting, we'll talk. Fair?"*

**Response (Option B — gentle redirect):**
*"I will — but emails don't do this justice. Give me 90 seconds to explain what I'll put in it, and if it's not relevant, I won't even bother sending it. Fair? ... [Go into elevator pitch]"*

### 13. "Call me back later" / "Now's not a good time"

**Psychology:** Sometimes true, sometimes a brush-off.

**Response:**
*"Absolutely — when's better? Tomorrow at [time] or [day] at [time]? ... I'll put it on my calendar. Quick heads-up on what we'll cover so you know it's worth your time: [one-sentence value prop]. Talk to you [day]."*

(Always get a SPECIFIC time. "Later" = never.)

### 14. "We don't have the budget right now"

**Psychology:** Different from "too expensive." This is a timing issue.

**Response:**
*"I understand — budget cycles are real. Two thoughts: First, this typically pays for itself within 60 days through [time saved / revenue gained], so the budget question often solves itself quickly. Second, we offer a payment plan — $2,500 to start, $2,500 at 30 days. That way you're already seeing ROI before the second payment hits. Would that make it workable?"*

### 15. "How is this different from ChatGPT / other AI tools?"

**Psychology:** Legitimate comparison question. They need differentiation.

**Response:**
*"Great question. ChatGPT is a general-purpose conversation tool — you type something in, it types something back. ClawStart is a fully deployed operations system customized to your business. Here's the difference:*

*ChatGPT: You ask it questions manually, one at a time.*
*ClawStart: It proactively handles your email, calendar, lead follow-up, CRM updates, and client communication — 24/7 — without you doing anything.*

*It's like comparing a search engine to having a full-time employee. The search engine has information. The employee takes action. We build the employee."*

### 16. "What's the ROI? Prove it."

**Psychology:** Analytical buyer. Wants numbers. This is actually a buying signal.

**Response:**
*"Love that question. Let's do the math right now based on YOUR numbers. [Pull out ROI calculation]:*

*You said you get [X leads/month]. You're missing [Y%]. Each is worth [$Z]. That's $[X × Y% × Z] in lost revenue per month — $[annual] per year.*

*ClawStart costs $5,000 to set up and $250/month — $8,000 in year one. If we recover even [conservative percentage] of those missed leads, that's $[number] — a [X]x return.*

*And that's just leads. We haven't even counted the [15-20 hours/week] your team gets back. At $[hourly rate], that's another $[number]/year.*

*Does that math work for you?"*

### 17. "I want to talk to your existing clients first"

**Psychology:** Social proof seeker. This is a strong buying signal — they're doing due diligence.

**Response:**
*"Absolutely. I'll connect you with [client reference]. While I set that up, let me also send you [case study / testimonial]. In the meantime, can we pencil in a follow-up call for [specific day] so we can keep momentum going?"*

### 18. "What happens if we want to cancel?"

**Psychology:** Fear of commitment. Want an escape hatch.

**Response:**
*"Simple — the managed care is month-to-month. If it's not working for you, you can cancel anytime with 30 days notice. No long-term contracts on the monthly service. The setup fee covers building your custom system, which you keep. We're confident enough in the value that we don't need to lock you in. Most clients don't leave because, frankly, they can't imagine going back."*

### 19. "I need to do more research"

**Psychology:** Uncertainty. They don't have enough information to feel confident.

**Response:**
*"Smart. What specifically do you want to research? ... [Listen] ... What if I could answer that right now? The fastest way to research this is to see it in action. Let me show you a 15-minute demo customized to your business — that'll answer more questions than any Google search. If it doesn't make sense after that, I'll save you the research time and tell you myself."*

### 20. "We're locked into a contract with another vendor"

**Psychology:** Real logistical barrier, but not insurmountable.

**Response:**
*"When does that contract end? ... [Get date] ... Perfect. Let's do this: I'll set up a demo now so you can see what's possible. That way when your contract is up, you can make the switch seamlessly. No rush — I just want you to have all the information. In the meantime, ClawStart might actually complement what you have, not replace it. Want to explore that?"*

### 21. "AI is going to replace my employees"

**Psychology:** Ethical concern. Fear that they're making people redundant.

**Response:**
*"I completely understand that concern — and I want to be direct: that's not what this does. ClawStart handles the tasks your employees hate doing — data entry, repetitive follow-ups, scheduling coordination. It frees them to do the work they're actually good at and were hired for. Nobody's losing their job — they're getting promoted from busywork to real work. Your team will love this."*

### 22. "Let me talk to my IT person first"

**Psychology:** Deferring to a technical authority. Sometimes legitimate, sometimes a stall.

**Response:**
*"Makes sense. I'd actually love to loop them in — we can do a quick technical overview together. That way they can ask the questions they need to and we're not playing phone tag. Can you introduce us via email today? I'll set up a 15-minute technical call."*

# SECTION 5: CLOSING TECHNIQUES

## The Assumptive Close

Act as if they've already decided. Skip "would you like to..." and go straight to logistics.

*"Great — so for your setup, I'd recommend the Growth plan since [reason]. We can kick off next week — does Tuesday or Thursday work better for the onboarding call?"*

**When to use:** After a positive demo, when they've been nodding along, when they've said "this is great" or similar buying signals.

## The Alternative Close

Give them two yeses, not a yes/no.

*"Would you prefer to start with the Growth plan and expand later, or go straight to Enterprise and get everything set up at once?"*

*"Would you rather do the kickoff this week or next?"*

*"Do you want to pay the full setup upfront, or split it into two payments?"*

## The Urgency Close (Without Being Fake)

**Never manufacture fake urgency.** But real urgency exists:

*"We take on [X] new clients per month because each deployment needs dedicated attention. Right now I have [X] spots open for [month]. If you want to get started this month, I'd recommend we lock in your spot."*

*"Every week without this is another week of [specific cost they mentioned]. You told me you're losing [$ amount/month] — that's [$X] by the time we're 90 days out."*

## The ROI Close

Walk through the math live. On screen or on paper. Make them see the numbers.

*"Let's look at this together. You said you get [X] leads a month and close about [Y%]. Each deal is worth [$Z]. If ClawStart improves your response time and you close even [small %] more, that's [number] additional deals at [$Z each] = [$total]. The investment is $8,000 in year one. That's a [X]x return. Make sense?"*

**Then shut up.** Let the math speak.

## The "What Would It Mean" Close (Painting the Future)

*"Let me ask you something, [Name]. If 90 days from now, your leads are being followed up in under 2 minutes, your no-shows are cut in half, and your team has 15 extra hours a week — what would that mean for you? Not just the business... for you personally?"*

**Let them answer.** They'll paint their own picture. Then:

*"I can get you there. Let's start."*

## The Takeaway Close

Sometimes pulling back creates forward motion.

*"You know what, [Name]? I want to be honest — this might not be the right fit for everyone. It works best for businesses that are [describe their situation perfectly]. If that's not where you are, no hard feelings. But if it is... this is the move."*

## The Silence Close

After you present the price or ask for the sale: **SHUT. UP.**

The first person to speak after the price is stated loses negotiating power. Present the investment, then be silent. 5 seconds will feel like 5 minutes. Let them process. Let them decide. If you fill the silence with justification or backpedaling, you undermine your own confidence.

Count to 10 in your head if you have to. Just. Don't. Talk.

## Handling the Moment After Presenting Price

They might:
- **Say yes** → "Perfect. Here's what happens next..." (have onboarding steps ready)
- **Go silent** → Wait. Let them think. Don't panic.
- **Wince or hesitate** → "What are you thinking?" (open-ended, not defensive)
- **Object** → Handle using the playbook above
- **Ask for a discount** → "The price reflects the value. But I can offer a payment plan — $2,500 now, $2,500 in 30 days."

# SECTION 6: THE COMPLETE DISCOVERY CALL BLUEPRINT

## The 20-Minute Discovery Call — Full Script

### Pre-Call (5 min before)
- Review your pre-call research notes
- Get into state: physiology, breathing, focus
- Have their website open on your screen
- Have a notepad ready (or CRM notes open)
- Know their name, company, and the pain point you'll lead with

### Minute 0-2: The Warm Open

*"Hey [Name], thanks for taking the time! I'm [You] with ClawStart. Before we dive in, I want to make sure this is a good use of your time — so my goal for the next 20 minutes is simple: I want to understand your business, see if there's a fit, and if there is, show you exactly what we can do. If there's not a fit, I'll tell you honestly. Sound good?"*

**Why this works:** You've set the frame (20 minutes, honest assessment), positioned yourself as a consultant (not desperate), and gotten micro-agreement ("sound good?").

### Minute 2-5: Situation Questions

*"So tell me about [Company]. Walk me through a typical day — how does your operation run?"*

Listen. Take notes. Then:

*"How many people are on your team? Who handles the day-to-day operations — scheduling, client communication, follow-ups?"*

*"What tools are you using right now for [CRM/scheduling/communication]?"*

**Goal:** Understand their world. Map the landscape.

### Minute 5-10: Problem & Implication Questions

*"So where does the ball get dropped most often? What falls through the cracks?"*

*"When that happens — a lead doesn't get followed up, a patient no-shows, a client doesn't hear from you — what's the impact?"*

*"How many hours a week would you say your team spends on repetitive tasks — scheduling, follow-ups, data entry?"*

*"What does that cost you? If you had to put a dollar amount on the inefficiency..."*

*"And what happens if nothing changes? Where are you in 12 months?"*

**Goal:** Make the pain tangible. Make inaction expensive.

### Minute 10-12: Transition to Solution

*"Makes total sense. So here's why I think there might be a fit — what you're describing is exactly what we built ClawStart to solve. Let me show you how."*

**Don't ask permission to pitch. You've earned it with good questions. Transition with confidence.**

### Minute 12-17: The Demo / Solution Presentation

*"Here's how ClawStart would work for [Company Name] specifically..."*

Walk through 2-3 scenarios based on what they told you:

1. **Scenario matching their #1 pain:** *"You said leads sit for hours before getting a response. Here's what happens with ClawStart — [show/describe automated lead response]."*

2. **Scenario matching their #2 pain:** *"And those [hours/week] on scheduling and follow-ups? Here's how the AI handles that — [show/describe automation]."*

3. **The ROI moment:** *"Based on what you told me — [their numbers] — here's what the math looks like: [walk through specific ROI]. The investment is $5,000 for setup and $250/month. Year one cost: $8,000. Year one ROI: $[their specific number]. That's a [X]x return."*

### Minute 17-19: The Close

*"So, [Name] — based on everything you've shared, I think this is a no-brainer for [Company]. Here's what I'd recommend: we go with the [Growth/Enterprise] plan, kick off setup next [day], and have you live within 2 weeks. Does that work for you?"*

**If yes:** *"Perfect. I'll send over the agreement today. The setup fee is $5,000 — would you prefer to pay in full or split it into two payments? ... Great. I'll also schedule our kickoff call for [specific date/time]. You're going to love this."*

**If they need to think:** Use "I need to think about it" response from the objection playbook.

**If they have objections:** Handle using the playbook. Then re-close.

### Minute 19-20: Next Steps (if not closed today)

*"Here's what I'm going to do: I'll send you a summary of what we discussed, the ROI numbers specific to your business, and a link to get started. I'll also include a case study from a similar [industry] business. Let's schedule a follow-up for [specific day/time] — that way if any questions come up, we can address them and get you moving. [Day] at [time] work?"*

**ALWAYS leave with:**
1. A specific next step
2. A specific date/time
3. An action item you'll deliver first (creates reciprocity)
