This isn't sales basics. This is the "next level" — the creative strategies, growth hacks, and positioning moves that will make Summit Digital the only choice for Colorado Springs businesses.

# STRATEGY 1: THE PRE-BUILT MOCKUP (Your "Collison Install")

## The Origin Story

When Stripe was starting out, Patrick and John Collison did something nobody else did. Instead of saying "check out our product and sign up when you're ready," they'd say **"give me your laptop"** and install Stripe right there, on the spot. No friction. No "I'll think about it." By the end of the conversation, they were already a customer.

This is the most powerful sales move for Summit Digital. **You walk in with their website already built.**

## How Summit Digital Does the Collison Install

**The Move:** Don't just TELL them you build websites. **SHOW THEM THEIR WEBSITE. Already mocked up. Before they ever asked.**

### The Script:

*"[Name], I know you're probably skeptical — every web designer says they'll build you a great site. But I'm not here to talk about what I could do. I'm here to show you what I already did. I built a mockup of your website. It has your business name, your services, your area. Let me show you — takes 2 minutes."*

### What You Show Them:
1. A professional homepage mockup with their business name and services
2. The AI chatbot in action — "See this? A customer asks about your services at 10 PM, and this chatbot answers and captures their info."
3. Mobile-responsive view — "This is how it looks on a phone. That's where 70% of your customers are."
4. Google review integration concept — "This system asks every happy customer for a review. Automatically."

### Why This Works:
- **Eliminates "I need to think about it"** — they can see it RIGHT NOW
- **Eliminates "will it look good?"** — they're already looking at it
- **Eliminates "is this complicated?"** — it's already done
- **Creates ownership** — psychologically, they now OWN this thing. It has THEIR name on it. Not having it feels like loss.
- **Massive differentiation** — NO other web designer in COS walks in with a pre-built mockup. Nobody.

### Implementation:
- Build 5-10 industry templates (plumber, restaurant, auto shop, dentist, etc.)
- Before any outreach, spend 15-20 minutes customizing a template for the specific business
- Load it on your iPad. Walk in. Show them.
- Even if they don't close that day, they'll have the image of their website burned into their brain

### The Follow-Up After Showing a Mockup:

Day 1: *"Hey [Name], wanted to follow up on the mockup I showed you yesterday. Still looks great, right? 😄 I can have it live in 2 weeks. Want to get started?"*

This is a layup. They've already seen it. They just need to say yes.

---

# STRATEGY 2: THE FREE MOCKUP PILOT

## Structure: "I'll Build It, You'll Love It"

**Who qualifies:** Any prospect who's interested but needs a push.

**What they get:** A fully designed homepage mockup, free of charge. No commitment.

**What you get:** A nearly guaranteed close when they see their business looking incredible online.

### The Pitch:

*"Tell you what — I'm confident enough in my work that I'll put my money where my mouth is. Let me build a mockup of your website. Free. No obligation. You look at it, and if you love it, we'll talk about making it live. If you don't, you walk away and I eat the time. Fair?"*

### Mockup Rules:
1. **Only for real prospects** — don't build mockups for tire-kickers
2. **Limited scope** — homepage only, not a full multi-page site
3. **Include the differentiators** — show the chatbot, show the review widget
4. **Deliver within 48 hours** — speed impresses and maintains momentum
5. **Schedule the reveal** — don't just email it. Walk them through it on a call or in person.
6. **Clear transition** — "Love it? Great. $[price] and you're live in 2 weeks."

### The Conversion Path:
\`\`\`
Free Mockup → Mockup Reveal (in person/call) → Full Build ($2K-$5K) → Monthly Maintenance ($150-$250/mo)
\`\`\`

### Why This Works:
- **Loss aversion** — After seeing their name on a beautiful website, NOT having it feels like a loss
- **Proof over promises** — They've seen exactly what they're getting
- **Reduces risk** — They're not buying blind
- **Creates urgency** — "I built this for you. All we have to do is turn it on."

### Guard Rails:
- Max 3-5 active mockups at a time (protect your time)
- Track mockup conversion rate — should be 60%+ if you're qualifying well
- Only build mockups for businesses you've talked to (not random)

# STRATEGY 3: REFERRAL & PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM

## Client Referral Program

**Offer:** $250 off their next month of maintenance for every referral that closes.

**How it works:**
1. At 30-60 days post-launch, ask for referrals
2. Client introduces you to a business owner they know
3. If that business signs up, the referring client gets $250 credit
4. That's 1-2 months free maintenance — real value

**Script for asking:**
*"[Name], your site's been live for [X] weeks now and it's looking great. Who else do you know — maybe another business owner, someone at your BNI group, a friend who owns a shop — who needs a website? I'd love an introduction. And I'll credit your account $250 for every referral that signs up."*

## Strategic Partners

**Target Partners:**
- Business consultants and coaches in COS
- Accountants/CPAs (they see every small business's financials and pain)
- Insurance agents (they know every business owner in town)
- Commercial real estate agents (they know every new business opening)
- Print shops and sign companies (businesses getting signs also need websites)
- Marketing freelancers who DON'T do web design
- IT support companies
- Chamber of Commerce leaders

**Offer:** $250-$500 referral fee for every client they send that closes.
- $2K build = $250 referral fee
- $3.5K build = $350 referral fee
- $5K build = $500 referral fee

# STRATEGY 4: CONTENT & SOCIAL MEDIA ENGINE

## The One-Person Content Machine

You're solo, CD. But you can still own LinkedIn and Facebook in Colorado Springs.

### Posting Schedule:
- **3x per week** on LinkedIn and Facebook
- Rotate content types
- Every post is about Colorado Springs businesses (local = engagement)

### Post Templates:

**Template 1: "Before & After" Story**
\`\`\`
What happens when a Colorado Springs plumber gets a real website?

Week 1: "Is this even going to do anything?"
Week 2: "Wait, someone booked through the chatbot at 9 PM?"
Week 4: "I got 3 calls this week from Google. That's never happened before."
Month 3: "I need to hire a helper — can't keep up."

This is real. This is happening right now in COS.

If your business isn't online, you're invisible.

DM me for a free mockup of your website.

#ColoradoSprings #SmallBusiness #WebDesign
\`\`\`

**Template 2: ROI Stat Bomb**
\`\`\`
Quick math for Colorado Springs business owners:

Your average customer is worth $300.
You're losing 5 customers/month because you don't show up on Google.
That's $1,500/month — $18,000/year — walking to your competitors.

A professional website with AI chatbot costs $2,000-$3,500.

One month of recovered customers pays for the entire thing.

The math isn't even close.

DM me if you want a free mockup.
\`\`\`

**Template 3: Hot Take / Contrarian**
\`\`\`
Unpopular opinion:

Your Instagram following doesn't matter if you don't have a website.

Instagram doesn't show up when someone Googles
"plumber Colorado Springs" or "dentist near me."

A website does.

Social media is rented land.
Your website is property you own.

Build on land you own.

\`\`\`

**Template 4: Behind the Scenes / Mockup Reveal**
\`\`\`
Just built a website mockup for a barbershop on Academy Blvd.

The owner's reaction when I walked in and showed him:
"Wait — you already built this? For MY shop?"

That's what I do. I build the mockup BEFORE you hire me.
If you love it, we make it live. If not, no charge.

# STRATEGY 5: LOCAL DOMINATION — COLORADO SPRINGS

## The Colorado Springs Playbook

You're local. Use it. Nobody trusts a faceless company from India or a freelancer on Fiverr. But they trust the guy who drives the same streets, eats at the same restaurants, and knows Colorado Springs.

### Chamber of Commerce & Business Groups
- **Join:** Colorado Springs Chamber, Pikes Peak Small Business Development Center
- **Cost:** $200-$500/year (one client pays for 3+ years)
- **Strategy:** Attend monthly events. Don't sell — connect. Be the "website guy" everyone knows.
- **Offer to speak:** "Does Your Business Need a Website in 2026? What Every COS Business Owner Needs to Know" — 15-minute presentation at a chamber event

### BNI Groups (Business Network International)
- **What:** Weekly referral groups of 20-40 business owners, one per profession
- **Why:** Built-in referral machine. Every member is committed to referring business.
- **Strategy:** Join as the "Web Design" member
- **COS BNI chapters:** Multiple groups to choose from
- **Cost:** ~$500/year + weekly breakfast
- **Expected ROI:** 2-5 referrals per quarter from your chapter alone

### Coworking Space Partnerships
- **Target:** Local coworking spaces in COS (Epicentral, CoVenture, etc.)
- **Offer:** Free "Does Your Business Need a Website?" lunch-and-learn for their members
- **What you provide:** Pizza + a killer presentation + mockup demos
- **What they provide:** A room full of business owners and entrepreneurs
- **Close rate:** 15-25% of attendees will want a mockup

### Local Events to Attend/Sponsor
- **1 Million Cups COS** — Weekly entrepreneur meetup
- **Pikes Peak Entrepreneurship events**
- **Local business expos and fairs**
- **Neighborhood business association meetings**
- **Rotary clubs, Kiwanis, Lions clubs**
- **Military spouse business groups** (huge market in COS)

### The Lunch-and-Learn Strategy

**Offer:** Free 30-minute "Does Your Business Need a Website in 2026?" presentation for any business group.

**Format:**
1. **5 min:** "Who here doesn't have a website — or hasn't updated theirs in 2+ years?" (engagement)
2. **10 min:** "Here's what customers actually do before buying from you" (education with local examples)
3. **5 min:** Live mockup — build/show a website for an audience member's business (wow factor)
4. **5 min:** Q&A
5. **5 min:** "I'll build a free mockup for anyone here who wants to see what their site could look like." (CTA)

**Where to do them:**
- Chamber events
- BNI group (your weekly presentation)
- Coworking spaces
- Business association meetings
- Even a local coffee shop — invite 5 business owners for coffee and a presentation

**Conversion:** Every lunch-and-learn should produce 3-5 mockup requests.

### The Door-to-Door Blitz

Dedicate 2-3 afternoons per week to driving business corridors:
- **Tuesday:** Academy Blvd corridor
- **Wednesday:** Powers Blvd / Briargate area
- **Thursday:** Downtown / Old Colorado City / Manitou

Walk in to 5-10 businesses per afternoon. iPad ready. Mockup templates loaded. Business cards in pocket.

This is your unfair advantage. Nobody else is doing this in COS.

# STRATEGY 6: THE CASE STUDY FACTORY

## First 5 Clients = Case Study Partners

**The Deal:** Offer your first 3-5 clients a 10-20% discount in exchange for:
1. A case study with their name and business
2. A Google review for Summit Digital
3. Permission to show their site as an example
4. A before/after comparison (if they had an old site or none)

### Case Study Template

\`\`\`

# STRATEGY 7: THE FREE WEBSITE AUDIT LEAD MAGNET

## The Concept

Offer a **free 10-minute website audit** (or "online presence audit" for businesses without a site).

### What It Is:
A quick review of their current online presence — website (or lack of), Google reviews, Google Maps listing, mobile-friendliness, competitor comparison — with a 1-page summary of what they're missing.

### Why It Converts:
- **Low commitment** — "Free" + "10 minutes" = easy yes
- **High value** — They see concrete problems with their online presence
- **Natural transition** — The audit reveals problems, Summit Digital is the solution
- **Authority positioning** — You're the expert analyzing their business

### The Audit Process:

**Pre-Audit (2 min):** Quick check:
1. Do they have a website? How does it look?
2. Is it mobile-friendly?
3. How many Google reviews?
4. How does their Google Maps listing look?
5. How do competitors compare?

**The Audit (10 min):**
1. Share your screen or show them on the iPad (2 min)
2. "Here's what customers see when they search for you" (3 min)
3. "Here's what they see when they search for your competitor" (2 min)
4. "Here's what I'd fix" (3 min)

**Post-Audit Deliverable (1-page summary):**

\`\`\`
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
ONLINE PRESENCE AUDIT
[Business Name] | [Date]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CURRENT STATE:
Website: [None / Outdated / OK]
Mobile-Friendly: [Yes / No]
Google Reviews: [X] (competitor average: [Y])
Google Maps: [Complete / Incomplete]
AI Chatbot: [No]

WHAT YOU'RE MISSING:
1. [Issue] — Impact: [what it costs them]
2. [Issue] — Impact: [what it costs them]
3. [Issue] — Impact: [what it costs them]

ESTIMATED IMPACT:
→ Customers lost per month: [X]
→ Revenue lost per year: $[X]

RECOMMENDED FIX:
Summit Digital [Package]
Investment: $[X] + $[X]/month maintenance
Timeline: Live in 2 weeks

NEXT STEP:
Want to see a mockup? → [phone] / [email]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
\`\`\`

### How to Drive Traffic to the Audit:
- Every social post: "Want a free audit of your online presence? DM me."
- Walk-ins: "Even if you're not ready for a website, let me do a quick free audit."
- Networking events: "I'll do a free online presence audit for anyone here."
- Business cards: "Free Website Audit → [QR code to booking page]"
- Facebook ads targeting COS business owners: "Is your business invisible on Google? Free 10-minute audit."

# STRATEGY 8: UPSELL & EXPANSION PLAYBOOK

## The Land-and-Expand Model

**Start with the website → add services over time.**

### Expansion Path:
\`\`\`
Starter Website ($2K) → Add Chatbot ($500) → Add Reviews ($500) → Full Package ($3.5-5K) → Monthly Maintenance → Additional Pages/Features
\`\`\`

### The Upsell Timeline:

| Timing | Upsell | Trigger | Script |
|---|---|---|---|
| At close | Chatbot add-on | They chose Starter | "For $500 more, I'll add the AI chatbot. That's what captures leads at 2 AM. Totally worth it." |
| 30 days | Review management | Site is live, getting traffic | "Your site looks great. Now let's get those reviews flowing. $500 one-time setup." |
| 60 days | Additional pages | They want to expand | "Want to add a blog? Portfolio page? Testimonials page? $300-$500 per page." |
| 90 days | SEO optimization | They want more traffic | "Your site is performing well. Want to take it to the next level with local SEO? $500-$1,000." |
| Ongoing | Redesign/refresh | After 18-24 months | "Time for a refresh — design trends change. $1,000-$2,000 for a modern update." |

### Add-On Revenue Menu:

| Add-On | Price | Description |
|---|---|---|
| AI Chatbot | $500 | 24/7 customer chat + lead capture |
| Google Review Management | $500 | Automated review collection system |
| Additional pages | $300-$500/page | Blog, portfolio, services, about, etc. |
| Local SEO setup | $500-$1,000 | Google Maps optimization, local citations |
| Logo design | $300-$500 | Professional logo if they don't have one |
| Business card design | $150-$250 | Matching business cards |
| Social media setup | $300-$500 | Facebook, Instagram, Google Business Profile optimization |
| Email marketing setup | $500 | Mailchimp/email list setup + first campaign |
| Monthly maintenance | $150-$250/mo | Hosting, updates, security, changes |

# STRATEGY 9: PRICING PSYCHOLOGY

## Why $2,000-$5,000 Is the Sweet Spot

- **Under $1,000 feels cheap** — "If it costs $500, is it going to look like a $500 website?"
- **$2,000 feels professional** — Serious enough to be real, accessible enough for any business
- **$3,500 feels like the right investment** — Includes everything, no corners cut
- **$5,000 feels premium** — For businesses that want the best (dental, legal, real estate)
- **Over $5,000 is agency territory** — Save that for when you scale

$2,000-$5,000 is the "Goldilocks range" for Colorado Springs small businesses. Real investment, real value, real results.

## The Anchoring Play

**ALWAYS present the Premium package first.**

*"I have three packages. Premium is $5,000 — that's the full works: custom multi-page website, AI chatbot, Google review management, local SEO, and monthly maintenance. Growth is $3,500 — website, chatbot, and reviews. And Starter is $2,000 — a clean, professional website to get you online. Based on what you've told me, I'd recommend Growth at $3,500 — it gives you everything you need to start generating leads."*

**What just happened:**
- You said "$5,000" first. That's the anchor.
- $3,500 feels like a DEAL compared to $5,000.
- $2,000 feels like the bare minimum (nobody wants the cheapest option).
- You recommended the middle tier — you're advising, not upselling.

## Making $150-$250/Month Feel Like Nothing

**The Daily Breakdown:**
*"$150/month is $5/day. That's less than your morning coffee. Except this keeps your website running, secure, updated, and working for you 24/7."*

**The Employee Comparison:**
*"$250/month is what you'd pay someone for 2 hours of work. Except this covers hosting, security, updates, and changes all month long."*

**The Revenue Frame:**
*"$150/month. One extra customer from your website pays for the entire year of maintenance. Everything else is free."*

## Payment Plans

**Standard Payment Plan:**
- Half at signing, half at launch (2 weeks later)

**Script:**
*"I can split it — $[half] to get started, and $[half] when we launch. By the time the second payment hits, you'll already be live and getting traffic."*

# STRATEGY 10: BRAND VOICE & POSITIONING

## Summit Digital Co Brand Identity

**Summit Digital is NOT:**
- A faceless agency
- A cheap freelancer on Fiverr
- Complicated or techy
- Pushy or aggressive

**Summit Digital IS:**
- Local to Colorado Springs
- Professional and results-driven
- Approachable and straightforward
- Full-service (website + chatbot + reviews + maintenance)
- The obvious choice for COS businesses

### What Makes Summit Digital Different (Competitive Advantages):

1. **Pre-built mockups** — Walk in with their website already designed. Nobody else does this.
2. **AI chatbot included** — It's not just a website. It's a lead capture system. Most web designers don't offer this.
3. **Google review management** — Most designers build a site and disappear. You manage their entire online reputation.
4. **Full-service monthly maintenance** — They never think about their website again. Most freelancers don't offer ongoing support.
5. **Colorado Springs local** — You drive the same streets. You know the market. You're accountable because they know where to find you.
6. **Fast turnaround** — 2 weeks, not 2 months. Business owners don't want to wait.
7. **Affordable packages** — Not $10-$20K agency pricing. Real pricing for real small businesses.

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds):

*"I'm Chris with Summit Digital — I build websites for Colorado Springs businesses. But I'm not your typical web designer. I walk in with a mockup of your website already built. If you love it, I add an AI chatbot that captures leads 24/7, set up Google review management, and handle monthly maintenance. Full-service, live in 2 weeks, starting at $2,000. Most of my clients make that back within the first month."*

### One-Liner (10 seconds):

*"I build professional websites for COS businesses — with AI chatbots and review management. Live in 2 weeks."*
