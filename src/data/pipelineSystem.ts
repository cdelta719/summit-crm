# SECTION 1: PIPELINE STAGES (Detailed)

## Stage 1: LEAD

**Definition:** You've identified a Colorado Springs business that needs a website. They don't know you yet.

**Entry Criteria:** Business found via Google Maps research, drive-by, networking, referral tip, or any other source. They have no website, a terrible website, or no online presence.

**Exit Criteria:** You have a business name, owner name (if possible), phone number, and a pain point observation. Lead moves to "Contact Made."

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Identify business (from Google Maps, driving corridors, referrals, etc.)
- [ ] Quick research: Do they have a website? How many Google reviews? Competitors?
- [ ] Find owner/decision maker name and contact info
- [ ] Write 1-sentence observation ("No website — losing to [competitor]" or "Site is outdated and not mobile-friendly")
- [ ] Add to tracker with all fields
- [ ] Optional: Start building a mockup from your template

**Time Limit:** 5 minutes max per lead. Don't over-research. Action beats information.

**Template — Lead Research Notes:**

Owner/Contact: _______________ 
Phone: _______________ Email: _______________

Industry/Vertical: _______________

Notes: _______________
\`\`\`

---

## Stage 2: CONTACT MADE

**Definition:** You've reached out — cold call, walk-in, email, or text. Goal is to show them a mockup or book a meeting.

**Entry Criteria:** First outreach attempt made.

**Exit Criteria:** Mockup presented (move to Stage 4) OR meeting booked (move to Stage 3) OR unresponsive after full cadence (move to nurture).

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Make first contact (call, walk-in, email, or text)
- [ ] Log the outcome
- [ ] If walk-in: show mockup on the spot (skip to Stage 4)
- [ ] If phone: pitch the mockup viewing — "I built something for you, can I show you?"
- [ ] If no answer: leave voicemail + send email/text with mockup tease
- [ ] Follow the 7-touch cadence (see Section 4)
- [ ] Log every touchpoint

**Time Limit:** 21 days for full cadence. If no response after 7 touches, move to "Nurture" list for monthly re-engagement.

**Template — First Contact Email:**
\`\`\`
Subject: I built a website mockup for [Business Name]

Hey [Name],

I'm Chris with Summit Digital — I'm a web designer here in
Colorado Springs. I noticed [Business Name] doesn't have a 
website [or 'could use a website refresh'] and I actually
took the time to mock up what a professional site could
look like for you.

It includes an AI chatbot that captures leads 24/7 and
Google review management.

Want to see it? Takes 5 minutes.

## Stage 3: MEETING BOOKED

**Definition:** You have a scheduled time to present the mockup — in person, Zoom, or phone.

**Entry Criteria:** Prospect confirmed a specific date/time for a mockup presentation or meeting.

**Exit Criteria:** Meeting completed (move to Stage 4: Mockup Sent/Shown).

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Send confirmation text: "Hey [Name], we're all set for [day] at [time]. Looking forward to showing you what I put together for [Business Name]!"
- [ ] Customize mockup specifically for their business (if not already done)
- [ ] Research their competitors (have comparison ready)
- [ ] Calculate their specific ROI scenario
- [ ] Send reminder day-of: "See you at [time] today! 🤙"

**Time Limit:** Meeting should happen within 5 business days of booking. Longer = colder.

---

## Stage 4: MOCKUP SENT / SHOWN

**Definition:** They've seen the mockup. They know what their website could look like. Now you're moving toward a proposal.

**Entry Criteria:** Mockup presented (in person, Zoom, or sent via email with a walkthrough).

**Exit Criteria:** Proposal sent (move to Stage 5) OR closed on the spot (move to Stage 6) OR not interested (move to Closed Lost).

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Present mockup with full walkthrough (design, chatbot, reviews, mobile)
- [ ] Show competitor comparison
- [ ] Walk through ROI math
- [ ] If they're ready: close on the spot → Stage 6
- [ ] If they need time: send follow-up with mockup link + pricing within 24 hours
- [ ] Complete presentation notes within 1 hour
- [ ] Score prospect (see Section 2)

**Time Limit:** Proposal must go out within 24 hours if not closed on the spot. Momentum is everything.

**Template — Mockup Follow-Up Email:**
\`\`\`
Subject: Your website mockup — [Business Name]

Hey [Name],

Great meeting today! Here's the mockup link so you can
check it out again (and show anyone else): [link]

## Stage 5: PROPOSAL SENT

**Definition:** You've sent pricing and package details. The ball is in their court — but you're still driving.

**Entry Criteria:** Formal pricing/proposal delivered (email, text, or in-person document).

**Exit Criteria:** Prospect accepts (Stage 6) OR declines (Stage 7).

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Send proposal with personal note (not just pricing — recap the value)
- [ ] If possible, walk them through pricing LIVE
- [ ] Follow post-proposal cadence (see Section 4)
- [ ] Prepare for objections (review Objection Handling in Training Manual)
- [ ] If no response in 48 hours: follow up with call/text
- [ ] If no response in 7 days: send value-add + check in

**Time Limit:** Proposals should close within 14 days. After 14 days, urgency is dying.

**What to Include in the Proposal:**
1. What they told you about their challenges (mirror their words)
2. What you're building (website, chatbot, reviews, maintenance)
3. The mockup link (they've already seen it — reinforce it)
4. The ROI math with THEIR numbers
5. Package and pricing
6. Timeline (live in 2 weeks)
7. Payment options
8. Social proof (testimonial, case study, example)
9. Clear CTA ("Ready? Reply 'let's go' and I'll get started.")

**Presenting Price — The Right Way:**
1. Always present Premium ($5K) first, then Growth ($3.5K), then Starter ($2K). Anchoring works.
2. Never say "cost" or "price." Say "investment."
3. Present in context of ROI: "The investment is $3,500. Based on what you told me, 3 extra customers a month pays for it in [X] months."
4. Offer the payment plan proactively.
5. Then STOP TALKING.

## Stage 6: CLOSED WON 🎉

**Definition:** They said yes. Payment received (or deposit received). Time to build.

**Entry Criteria:** Verbal or written yes + first payment received.

**Exit Criteria:** Website launched. Client in maintenance mode.

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Send "Let's Go!" confirmation email (template below)
- [ ] Process payment (or first installment)
- [ ] Create client folder (Google Drive)
- [ ] Send onboarding questionnaire (business info, photos, preferences)
- [ ] Schedule kickoff call/meeting within 3 business days
- [ ] Update tracker: Closed Won, log deal value, close date
- [ ] Celebrate! You earned it.
- [ ] Begin the build
- [ ] Launch within 2 weeks
- [ ] Ask for referral at 30-day mark

   and Google review management system.

| Build revenue | $4,000-$15,000 | $10,000-$40,000 |
| New maintenance MRR | $300-$750 | $750-$2,000 |
| Total pipeline value | $15,000+ | $40,000+ |

### Conversion Rates

| Leads → Contact Made | 100% (just reach out) |
| Contact Made → Mockup Shown | 20-30% |
| Mockup Shown → Proposal Sent | 60-80% |
| Proposal → Closed Won | 40-60% |

| Contact Made → Mockup Shown | 3-7 days |
| Mockup Shown → Proposal | Same day - 2 days |
| Proposal → Close | 3-10 days |
| Total | 7-21 days |

## Revenue Modeling

### Scenario 1: 3 Clients/Month (Startup Phase)
- Build revenue: $6,000-$15,000/month
- New MRR: $450-$750
- After 6 months: 18 clients × $200/mo avg = $3,600 MRR
- **Annual run rate: $72,000-$180,000 (builds) + $43,200 (recurring)**

### Scenario 2: 5 Clients/Month (Growth Phase)
- Build revenue: $10,000-$25,000/month
- New MRR: $750-$1,250
- After 6 months: 30 clients × $200/mo avg = $6,000 MRR
- **Annual run rate: $120,000-$300,000 (builds) + $72,000 (recurring)**

### Scenario 3: 8 Clients/Month (Crushing It)
- Build revenue: $16,000-$40,000/month
- New MRR: $1,200-$2,000
- After 6 months: 48 clients × $200/mo avg = $9,600 MRR
- **Annual run rate: $192,000-$480,000 (builds) + $115,200 (recurring)**

### The MRR Snowball

Every client adds recurring maintenance revenue that compounds:

| Month | New Clients | Total Clients | Build Revenue | MRR | Total Monthly |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3 | 3 | $9,000 | $600 | $9,600 |
| 2 | 3 | 6 | $9,000 | $1,200 | $10,200 |
| 3 | 4 | 10 | $12,000 | $2,000 | $14,000 |
| 4 | 4 | 14 | $12,000 | $2,800 | $14,800 |
| 5 | 5 | 19 | $15,000 | $3,800 | $18,800 |
| 6 | 5 | 24 | $15,000 | $4,800 | $19,800 |
| **6-Mo Total** | **24** | **24** | **$72,000** | **$4,800/mo** | **$87,200** |

By month 12, if you've signed 40+ clients, you're looking at $8,000+/month in MRR — that's $96K/year in recurring revenue on top of build fees.

**This is how you build a $200K+ solo business.**
