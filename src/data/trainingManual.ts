## The Complete Guide to Selling Web Design & Digital Services — For CD

*"The quality of your life is the quality of your questions." — Tony Robbins*

You're not reading this to learn theory. You're reading this to close deals. Every script, every technique, every word in here has one purpose: get Colorado Springs businesses online with Summit Digital. Let's go.

# SECTION 1: MINDSET & POSITIONING

## You Are NOT Selling Websites

Get this tattooed on your brain: **you are selling visibility, credibility, and revenue.**

When you pick up the phone or walk into a business, you're not pitching web design. You're there because the person on the other end is:
- Invisible on Google while competitors get all the calls
- Losing $10K-$50K/year because customers can't find them online
- Getting outshined by businesses with better websites and more reviews
- Missing leads at night, weekends, and every hour they're not by the phone

You are the person who fixes that. You are the consultant. You are the expert. You walk in with a mockup of their website already built before they even knew they needed one.

**Vendor vs. Consultant — Know the Difference:**

| Vendor Mindset | Consultant Mindset |
|---|---|
| "Let me tell you about our web design services" | "Tell me about your biggest challenge getting new customers" |
| "A website costs $3,500" | "This brings in $15K-$30K/year in new business — the investment is $3,500" |
| "Can I send you a brochure?" | "I actually built a mockup of your site — let me show you" |
| "I hope you'll consider us" | "Based on what I see, here's what I recommend" |
| Asks for permission | Shows up with the solution ready |
| Follows up meekly | Follows up with value |

## Tony Robbins Psychology of Selling

CD, you know this framework. Now apply it to every sales conversation.

### State Management — Before Every Call or Walk-In

Your state determines your outcome. Period. Before you dial or walk in:

1. **Physiology first.** Stand up. Shoulders back. Smile (they can hear it on the phone — and see it in person). Take 3 deep breaths. Move your body — jump, clap, do 10 pushups. You cannot close from a slumped position.
2. **Focus.** Ask yourself: "What am I grateful for right now?" Then: "How can I serve this business owner today?" You're not calling to take — you're calling to give.
3. **Incantations, not affirmations.** Say it with your body: "I am the best at what I do. I deliver massive value. Every business I help is going to crush it online." Feel it. Mean it.
4. **Peak state trigger.** Find your anchor — a song, a memory, a physical gesture. Use it before every power dial block and before every walk-in. Consistency creates certainty.

### The Six Human Needs in Sales

Every prospect is driven by these. Identify which ones dominate and speak to them:

1. **Certainty** — "This is proven. Here's exactly what you get. Here are businesses like yours already seeing results."
2. **Variety/Uncertainty** — "Imagine what becomes possible when customers are finding you online instead of you chasing them."
3. **Significance** — "You'd have the best-looking website of any [plumber/restaurant/etc.] in Colorado Springs. Your competitors won't know what hit them."
4. **Connection/Love** — "Your customers will feel like they're working with a professional, established business the moment they see your site."
5. **Growth** — "This frees you to focus on what actually grows the business — doing the work, not chasing leads."
6. **Contribution** — "Think about being able to hire that extra helper because the work keeps coming in."

**Pro tip:** Listen for which needs they express in the first 2 minutes. A plumber worried about losing jobs to competitors = certainty + significance. A restaurant owner overwhelmed with everything = growth + variety. Mirror their need back.

### Asking Quality Questions

Robbins says: "Successful people ask better questions." In sales, the person asking questions controls the conversation.

**Rules:**
- Never ask a question you don't know the answer to (strategically)
- Ask questions that make them feel the pain of being invisible online
- Ask questions that make them visualize having a professional web presence
- Ask questions where the answer sells for you

**Power Questions:**
- "When someone Googles '[their service] Colorado Springs,' do you show up?"
- "How many customers do you think you're losing every month because they can't find you online?"
- "What would it mean for your business if your phone started ringing from Google instead of just word of mouth?"
- "How many Google reviews do you have versus your biggest competitor?"
- "What happens if your competitors all get professional websites and you're still invisible?"

### Creating Certainty

People buy when they feel certain. Your job is to eliminate uncertainty at every stage:

- **Visual proof:** Show them the mockup. A picture is worth a thousand pitches.
- **Specificity:** Don't say "you'll get more customers." Say "businesses like yours see 5-10 extra calls per month from a professional website."
- **Demonstration:** The mockup IS your demo. Show, don't tell. Every time.
- **Risk reversal:** "If you're not happy with the design, I'll revise it until you love it."
- **Conviction:** If YOU aren't certain, they won't be. Know your product. Know your numbers. Know your value.

# SECTION 2: COLD CALLING & WALK-IN MASTERY

## Pre-Call/Walk-In Research Checklist (5 minutes max)

Before you call or walk in, pull up:

- [ ] **Google them** — Do they have a website? What does it look like? Is it mobile-friendly?
- [ ] **Google Reviews** — How many? What rating? What do reviews say? Any complaints about being hard to reach?
- [ ] **Google Maps** — Are they listed? Is the listing complete? Photos? Hours?
- [ ] **Competitors** — Google "[their service] Colorado Springs." Who shows up first? Do competitors have better sites?
- [ ] **Facebook/Instagram** — Are they active on social? Do they have a website link?
- [ ] **Business details** — What services? How long in business? Owner name?

**Write down ONE specific observation to lead with. ("I noticed you don't have a website" or "I saw your site isn't mobile-friendly" or "Your competitor has 200 reviews and you have 30.")**

## The Walk-In Strategy (Your Secret Weapon)

Most web designers send cold emails. You SHOW UP. With an iPad. With a mockup already built.

### The Walk-In Playbook:

**1. Drive the corridor** (Academy Blvd, Powers Blvd, Tejon St, etc.)
**2. Spot businesses** — local restaurants, auto shops, service businesses
**3. Google them on your phone** — no website? Terrible website? Bingo.
**4. Build a quick mockup** (if you haven't already — have templates ready)
**5. Walk in.** Confident. Smiling. iPad in hand.

### The Walk-In Script:

*"Hey! Are you the owner? ... I'm Chris with Summit Digital — I'm a web designer here in Colorado Springs. I was driving by and noticed [Business Name] doesn't have a website [or 'has a website that could use an update']. I actually took a few minutes and mocked up what a professional site could look like for you. Want to see it? It's right here on my iPad."*

**Then show them the mockup.** Let them react. Let them get excited. Let them imagine it.

*"This includes a built-in AI chatbot that answers customer questions 24/7 — hours, services, even booking. Plus I'd set up Google review management so you're collecting 5-star reviews on autopilot. The whole package is [$2,000-$3,500]. You'd be live in 2 weeks. What do you think?"*

### Why Walk-Ins Are Devastating (in the best way):
- **Nobody else does this.** They've never had a web designer walk in with a mockup.
- **Visual impact.** Seeing their business name on a professional website is emotional.
- **No cold outreach friction.** You're face-to-face. It's real.
- **You build rapport instantly.** You're a local guy helping local businesses.
- **You can close on the spot.** "Want to get started today?"

## The First 10 Seconds — Phone Calls

You have 10 seconds. That's it.

### What KILLS you in the first 10 seconds:
- "Hi, my name is Chris and I'm calling from Summit Digital" (telemarketer script)
- Speaking too fast (nervous energy = low status)
- Asking "How are you today?" (strangers don't ask that — salespeople do)
- Starting with features or company description

### What WINS in the first 10 seconds:
- **Pattern interrupt** — Say something unexpected
- **Relevant hook** — Reference something specific to THEM
- **Confident tone** — Peer-to-peer, like you're calling a fellow business owner
- **Brevity** — Get to the point. Respect their time.

### The Pattern Interrupt Technique

**Examples:**
- "Hey [Name], you're going to think this is a cold call — and honestly it kind of is — but I think you'll want to hear this. Got 30 seconds?"
- "[Name], quick question before you hang up on me — when someone Googles '[their service] Colorado Springs,' do you show up?"
- "Hey [Name], I'm a web designer in Colorado Springs and I actually built a mockup of a website for [Business Name]. Can I send it over?"

## Opening Scripts by Vertical

### Service Businesses (Plumbers, HVAC, etc.)
*"Hey [Name], this is Chris with Summit Digital. Quick question — when someone Googles 'plumber Colorado Springs,' are you showing up? ... [Let them answer] ... That's exactly why I'm calling. I build websites for service businesses in COS — professional sites with AI chatbots that capture leads 24/7. I actually mocked up a site for [Business Name]. Can I show it to you? Takes 5 minutes."*

### Restaurants
*"Hey [Name], this is Chris with Summit Digital. Quick question — does [Restaurant Name] have a website, or are you running on Facebook? ... [Let them answer] ... Yeah, that's super common. The problem is 60% of diners check the restaurant's website before going. I actually mocked up a site for you — menu, hours, location, everything. Can I send it over?"*

### Auto Shops
*"Hey [Name], this is Chris with Summit Digital. I help auto shops in Colorado Springs get found on Google — professional websites with review management. I noticed [Shop Name] has great reviews but no website. I mocked one up — want to see it?"*

### Medical/Dental
*"Hey [Name], this is Chris with Summit Digital. Quick question — when was your practice's website last updated? ... [Let them answer] ... I thought so. Patients judge your practice by your website before they ever call. I build modern, mobile-friendly practice sites with AI chatbots and Google review management. Worth 15 minutes to see what an updated site could look like?"*

## Tonality Guide

**How you say it matters more than what you say.** Practice these:

| Tonality | When to Use | How It Sounds |
|---|---|---|
| **Curious/Interested** | Asking questions, discovery | Genuine curiosity, like you're fascinated by their business |
| **Concerned** | Addressing their pain | Slightly lower pitch, slower pace — "That's probably costing you..." |
| **Confident/Matter-of-fact** | Presenting the solution | Steady, no uptick at end of sentences, no hedging language |
| **Playful/Light** | Pattern interrupts, rapport | Smile in your voice, slightly faster, relaxed |
| **Certain/Absolute** | Closing, handling objections | Firm, definitive — "Here's what I'd recommend." |
| **Peer-to-peer** | ALWAYS | You're a fellow business owner. Not below them or above them |

**Words to ELIMINATE:**
- "Just" — "I'm just calling to..." (minimizes you)
- "Honestly" — implies you're usually dishonest
- "Does that make sense?" — implies they might not understand
- "Sorry to bother you" — you're not sorry, you have value
- "I think" / "I believe" — say "Here's what I know" or "Here's what I see"
- "Cheap" / "Affordable" — say "investment" or "ROI"

**Words to USE:**
- "Specifically" — makes everything sound credible
- "Typically" — implies experience and track record
- "What I've found is..." — positions you as expert
- "Most [industry] owners in COS tell me..." — social proof
- "I'd recommend..." — consultant authority

## Voicemail Scripts That Get Callbacks

**Rules for voicemails:**
- Under 30 seconds. Period.
- Leave a curiosity gap — don't explain everything
- Sound like a human, not a pitch
- End with your number TWICE (slowly)

### Script 1: The Mockup Tease
*"Hey [Name], it's Chris — [phone number]. I'm a web designer in Colorado Springs and I actually built a mockup of a website for [Business Name]. Want to send it over. Give me a call at [phone number]. Talk soon."*

### Script 2: The Competitor Angle
*"[Name], this is Chris with Summit Digital. I was looking at [their industry] businesses in COS and noticed your main competitor has a killer website and 200+ Google reviews. I have an idea that could help you catch up. [Phone number]. That's [phone number]."*

### Script 3: The Direct
*"[Name], Chris with Summit Digital. I build websites for [industry] businesses in Colorado Springs — professional sites with AI chatbots and review management. I'd love to show you what I had in mind for [Business Name]. [Phone number]. Again, [phone number]."*

# SECTION 3: WARM LEAD SCRIPTS (Inbound/Referrals)

## Speed-to-Lead Framework

**The 5-Minute Rule: Call every inbound lead within 5 minutes.**

This is not optional. This is the single highest-ROI activity in your business.

- Leads called within 5 minutes: **21x more likely to qualify** (Harvard Business Review)
- Leads called after 24 hours: Basically cold calls at that point

### How to implement:
1. Set up instant notifications when a lead comes in from the website or social media
2. Drop everything and call within 5 minutes
3. If you can't call, send a personalized text within 2 minutes: *"Hey [Name], this is Chris from Summit Digital. Just saw your inquiry — I'd love to chat. Got 10 minutes right now, or when's a good time?"*

## Inbound Call Script

They came to YOU. The energy is different. You're not convincing — you're confirming.

*"Hey [Name]! Thanks for reaching out to Summit Digital. I saw you [filled out the form / messaged us / etc.]. I'd love to learn more about your business and see how I can help. What prompted you to look into getting a website?"*

**Then LISTEN.** Let them talk. They'll tell you exactly what to sell them.

**After they explain their situation:**
*"That makes total sense. I work with a lot of [industry] businesses in Colorado Springs dealing with exactly that. Here's what I'd recommend — [brief solution overview]. Want me to show you what your site could look like? I can mock something up and walk you through it."*

## Discovery Question Framework (SPIN Adapted for Summit Digital)

### Situation Questions (Understanding their world)
- "Tell me about your business. How long have you been in COS?"
- "How do most of your customers find you right now?"
- "Do you have a website currently? When was it last updated?"
- "How many Google reviews do you have?"
- "What's your biggest challenge when it comes to getting new customers?"

### Problem Questions (Finding the pain)
- "When someone Googles '[their service] Colorado Springs,' where do you show up?"
- "How many potential customers do you think are finding your competitors instead of you?"
- "What happens when someone wants to reach you after hours?"
- "How are you currently collecting Google reviews from happy customers?"
- "What's the most frustrating part of trying to grow your business?"

### Implication Questions (Making the pain HURT)
- "When a potential customer can't find you online, where do they go instead?"
- "How much is an average new customer worth to you? And how many do you think you're losing per month because you're invisible online?"
- "Your main competitor has [X] Google reviews and a professional website. What happens to your business in 12 months if that gap keeps growing?"
- "If you're relying only on word of mouth, what happens when that slows down?"

### Need-Payoff Questions (Let them sell themselves)
- "If your phone started ringing 5-10 more times a month from Google, what would that do for your business?"
- "What would it mean to have the best-looking website of any [industry] in Colorado Springs?"
- "If you had 100+ five-star Google reviews, how would that change things?"
- "What if customers could get their questions answered and book with you at midnight?"

**The key:** After implication questions, PAUSE. Let the silence work. They need to feel the weight of the problem before you show them the mockup.

## The Mockup Presentation (Your Killer Demo)

**This is your secret weapon. No other web designer in COS does this.**

**Setup (before the presentation):**
- Have a mockup ready that's customized to their business (use your templates)
- Know their industry, pain points, and what they told you
- Have competitor examples pulled up for comparison

**Presentation Flow (10-15 minutes):**

**1. Set the Stage (2 min)**
*"[Name], before I show you anything, let me recap what you told me — [pain point 1] and [pain point 2] are your biggest challenges right now. Is that right?"*

**2. Show the Competitor Gap (2 min)**
*"Here's what your competitor's website looks like: [show]. Clean, professional, easy to navigate. Now here's what someone finds when they search for you: [show — nothing, or an ugly site]. See the gap?"*

**3. The Mockup Reveal (5 min)**
*"Now here's what I built for you..."*

Pull up the mockup. Let them take it in. Watch their face.

Walk through:
- Homepage design (their name, their brand, their services)
- AI chatbot demo ("See this? When a customer visits at 10 PM and asks a question, this chatbot answers instantly and captures their info")
- Mobile version ("70% of searches are on phones — your site looks this good on mobile")
- Google review integration ("We'll set up a system that automatically asks happy customers for reviews")

**4. The ROI Moment (3 min)**
*"So based on what you told me — you're getting about [X] customers from word of mouth. If this website brings in just [2-5] extra customers per month at [$X average value], that's [$Y/year]. The investment is [$2,000-$5,000]. You'd make that back in [1-3 months]."*

**5. The Close (3 min)**
*"So — what do you think? Want to make this real? I can have you live in 2 weeks."*

## Follow-Up Cadence After Presentation

| Day | Action | Channel | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| Day 0 | Thank you + mockup link | Email/Text | "Great meeting today! Here's the mockup link so you can show [spouse/partner]. Let me know any questions." |
| Day 1 | Check-in | Text | "Hey [Name], any thoughts on the mockup? Happy to answer anything." |
| Day 3 | Value-add | Email | Share a "before/after" example or testimonial from a similar business |
| Day 7 | Direct ask | Call | "Wanted to check in — are you ready to move forward, or is there anything holding you back?" |
| Day 14 | Urgency | Text | "Just launched a site for a [similar business] in COS. They're already getting calls. Want me to get yours going?" |
| Day 30 | Re-engage | Call | "Hey [Name], circling back. I still have your mockup ready to go. Anything changed?" |

# SECTION 4: OBJECTION HANDLING PLAYBOOK

## The Psychology of Objections

**An objection is not a "no." It's a request for more information.**

When someone objects, they're telling you: "I'm interested enough to engage, but something is blocking me." Your job is to find the block and remove it.

**Rules:**
1. Never argue. Never get defensive.
2. Acknowledge the objection — make them feel heard
3. Ask a question to understand what's really going on
4. Reframe with the answer
5. Confirm the objection is resolved before moving on

### The "Feel, Felt, Found" Technique

*"I completely understand how you feel. Other business owners felt the same way. What they found was [reframe]."*

### The Isolation Technique

*"If we could solve [objection], is there anything else that would prevent us from moving forward?"*

---

## The 20+ Objections with Exact Responses

### 1. "It's too expensive" / "I can't afford that"

**Response:**
*"I hear you — $[price] is a real investment for a small business. Let me ask you this: how much is a new customer worth to you? ... [Let them answer] ... So if this website brings in just 2-3 extra customers per month, you've made your money back in [1-2 months] and everything after that is profit. Would a payment plan help? $[half] now and $[half] in 30 days?"*

### 2. "My nephew/friend/cousin can build me a website"

**Response:**
*"I hear that a lot. And some of them do a decent job. But here's what usually happens: they build a basic site, it sits there, nothing happens. No chatbot capturing leads. No review management. No maintenance. No local SEO. And when something breaks in 6 months, they're busy with their real job. I build a complete digital presence — website, AI chatbot, review management, and monthly maintenance. It's a business system, not just a pretty page. That's the difference."*

### 3. "I tried a website before and it didn't bring in any business"

**Response:**
*"What happened? ... [Listen] ... Yeah, that's really common. Most web designers build you a site and disappear. No SEO, no chatbot, no review strategy. A website without those things is like a billboard in the desert — it exists, but nobody sees it. What I do is different: the AI chatbot captures leads 24/7, the review management builds your Google presence, and I maintain the site monthly. It's a system, not just a page."*

### 4. "I get all my business from word of mouth"

**Response:**
*"That's great — and it tells me you do good work. But think about this: when someone gets your name from a friend, what do they do next? They Google you. If they find nothing — or a bad website — that referral just got a lot colder. A professional website CONFIRMS what word of mouth started. Plus, it brings in customers who don't know anyone who knows you."*

### 5. "I don't need a website, I have Facebook/Instagram"

**Response:**
*"Social media is great for engagement, but here's the problem: Facebook doesn't show up when someone Googles '[their service] Colorado Springs.' A website does. You're invisible to everyone who isn't already following you. That's a lot of customers. Plus — you don't own Facebook. They change the algorithm and your reach drops overnight. You OWN your website."*

### 6. "I need to think about it"

**Response (gentle isolation):**
*"Totally fair. Can I ask — what specifically do you want to think about? Is it the price, the timing, or whether it would actually work for your business? ... [Let them answer] ... [Address the specific concern]. If I could answer that for you right now, would you be comfortable moving forward today?"*

**Alternative (Robbins-style):**
*"I respect that. Let me ask you though — a month from now, will your competitor's website be better or worse than yours? And every month you wait, you're losing customers to businesses that ARE online. What if 30 days from now, instead of still thinking about it, your phone is ringing from Google?"*

### 7. "I want to get some other quotes"

**Response:**
*"Absolutely — smart to compare. What I'd suggest is this: look at what others offer for the same price. Most web designers will give you a website. Period. I give you a website + AI chatbot + Google review management + monthly maintenance. It's a complete digital presence package. When you compare apples to apples, Summit Digital is the best value in COS."*

### 8. "I don't have time to deal with this"

**Response:**
*"[Laugh gently] That's exactly why you need this. You're too busy running your business to worry about websites and Google. Here's how it works: I handle EVERYTHING. You spend 30 minutes with me for the initial setup — your info, your preferences, done. I build it, I launch it, I maintain it. The AI chatbot answers your customers' questions so you don't have to. You literally never have to think about it again."*

### 9. "Can't I just use Wix/Squarespace/GoDaddy?"

**Response:**
*"You could. And then you'd spend 40 hours trying to make it look right, it still won't have an AI chatbot, you won't have review management, and when something breaks, you'll Google 'how to fix my Wix site' at midnight. OR — you pay me to handle all of it professionally, and you spend those 40 hours doing what you're actually good at. Your time is worth more than fighting with a website builder."*

### 10. "Business is slow right now"

**Response:**
*"Business is slow BECAUSE customers can't find you. That's the whole point. When is the best time to plant a tree? 10 years ago. The second best time? Today. Every day without an online presence is a day your competitors are getting the calls that should be going to you."*

### 11. "I just started my business / I'm too new"

**Response:**
*"This is actually the BEST time to do it. Starting with a professional website from day one puts you ahead of 80% of businesses in your industry. Your competitors have been around for years without a website — you show up with a polished site, AI chatbot, and reviews from day one? That's a massive advantage."*

### 12. "Send me an email"

**Response (Option A):**
*"Happy to. But emails don't do this justice — let me send you the mockup instead. When you see your business name on a professional website, it's a whole different feeling. I'll send it over. What email should I use?"*

**Response (Option B):**
*"I will — but give me 60 seconds to explain what I'll put in it. If it's not relevant, I won't bother. Fair?"*

### 13. "Let me talk to my wife/husband/partner"

**Response:**
*"Absolutely — important decision. Can I ask: are you personally sold on it? ... [If yes] ... Great. What if I send you the mockup so you can show [them]? When they see what the website looks like, it sells itself. And I'm happy to do a quick call with both of you — just takes 10 minutes."*

### 14. "What if I don't like the design?"

**Response:**
*"That's why I showed you the mockup first — so you know exactly what you're getting before you pay. If there are changes you want, I make them. I don't stop until you love it. I've never had a client not love the final product."*

### 15. "I already have a website"

**Response:**
*"I know — I looked at it. [Be direct but kind.] When was it last updated? Is it mobile-friendly? Does it have a chatbot? How about review management? ... Most businesses I talk to have websites that are 3-5 years old and aren't doing anything for them. A website that doesn't generate leads is just an online brochure. Let me show you what a modern, lead-generating site looks like."*

### 16. "How long does it take?"

**Response:**
*"Two weeks from start to live. That's it. I'll have a first draft for you to review within a week, and you'll be live the following week. Fast and painless."*

### 17. "What happens if you get hit by a bus?" / "What if you disappear?"

**Response:**
*"Fair question. First — you own the website. It's on your domain, your hosting. Even if I got hit by a bus, your site keeps running. But I'm not going anywhere — I'm building a business here in Colorado Springs, and my reputation depends on every client being happy long-term. I'm not some freelancer on the internet. I'm your neighbor."*

### 18. "Do you have examples of your work?"

**Response:**
*"Absolutely — let me show you. [Show portfolio/examples.] And you've already seen the most important example — the mockup I built specifically for YOUR business. Nobody else does that."*

### 19. "What's included in the monthly maintenance?"

**Response:**
*"$[price]/month covers: hosting, security updates, content changes (up to [X]/month), chatbot maintenance, review management monitoring, and basic SEO monitoring. Think of it as your IT department for your website. You never have to think about whether your site is working, secure, or up to date."*

### 20. "I can't justify the expense right now"

**Response:**
*"I get it. Let me reframe it: you're not spending $3,500. You're investing $3,500 to bring in $15,000-$30,000/year in new business. Can you justify NOT doing it? Every month without a website is money walking to your competitors."*

# SECTION 5: CLOSING TECHNIQUES

## The Assumptive Close

Act as if they've already decided. Skip "would you like to..." and go straight to logistics.

*"Great — so I'll have the first draft to you by next [day]. I just need your business info and we'll get the domain secured. Want to start with $[half] today and the rest when we launch?"*

**When to use:** After showing the mockup and they're clearly excited.

## The Alternative Close

Give them two yeses, not a yes/no.

*"Would you prefer the Growth package with the AI chatbot, or the Starter package to keep it simple?"*

*"Would you rather launch by the end of this month or next?"*

*"Do you want to pay in full or split it into two payments?"*

## The Mockup Close (Your Unique Weapon)

*"You've seen the mockup. You love how it looks. I can have this live in 2 weeks. What do you say — let's make it real?"*

## The ROI Close

Walk through the math. On your iPad or on paper.

*"Let's do the math. You said a new customer is worth about $[X]. If this website brings in just 3 extra customers per month, that's $[X × 3] per month — $[annual]. The investment is $[price]. That's a [X]x return in year one. The math speaks for itself."*

**Then shut up.** Let the math speak.

## The "Where Will You Be" Close

*"[Name], a year from now — your competitor has a professional website, 200+ Google reviews, and an AI chatbot. And you're still relying on word of mouth. Where does that leave you? ... OR — a year from now, you have the best website in your industry in COS, your phone is ringing from Google, and you've got a wall of 5-star reviews. Which version do you want?"*

## The Silence Close

After you present the price: **SHUT. UP.**

The first person to speak after the price loses power. Present the investment, then be silent. Count to 10 in your head. Don't talk.

## Handling the Moment After Presenting Price

They might:
- **Say yes** → "Perfect. Let's get started. I just need [info] and we'll kick off this week."
- **Go silent** → Wait. Let them think.
- **Wince or hesitate** → "What are you thinking?" (open-ended, not defensive)
- **Object** → Handle using the playbook above
- **Ask for a discount** → "The price reflects the value. But I can do a payment plan — $[half] now, $[half] at launch."

# SECTION 6: THE COMPLETE SALES CONVERSATION BLUEPRINT

## The 15-Minute Mockup Presentation — Full Flow

### Pre-Meeting (5 min before)
- Review your research notes
- Get into state: physiology, breathing, focus
- Have their mockup loaded on your iPad/laptop
- Have competitor examples ready
- Know their name, business, and the pain point you'll lead with

### Minute 0-2: The Warm Open

*"Hey [Name], thanks for taking the time! I'm Chris with Summit Digital. I'm a web designer right here in Colorado Springs. My goal for the next 15 minutes is simple: show you what I had in mind for [Business Name], and if it makes sense, we'll talk about making it real. If not, no pressure at all. Sound good?"*

### Minute 2-5: Quick Discovery

*"Before I show you anything — tell me, how do most of your customers find you right now?"*

Listen. Then:

*"And when someone Googles '[their service] Colorado Springs,' where do you show up?"*

*"How many Google reviews do you have?"*

### Minute 5-7: The Competitor Gap

*"Let me show you something. I Googled '[their service] Colorado Springs.' Here's what comes up: [show competitors with good websites and reviews]. See how they show up? Now here's what happens when someone searches for you: [show — nothing, or a bad site]. There's a gap. And that gap is costing you customers every single day."*

### Minute 7-12: The Mockup Reveal

*"Here's what I built for [Business Name]..."*

Show the mockup. Walk through:
1. The design — their name, their brand, clean and professional
2. The AI chatbot — "This answers customer questions 24/7, even at midnight"
3. Mobile version — "This is how 70% of your customers will see it"
4. Review management — "This system automatically asks happy customers to leave reviews"
5. The ROI — "If this brings in just 3 extra customers a month at $[X] each..."

### Minute 12-15: The Close

*"So [Name] — this is what Summit Digital does for businesses in Colorado Springs. The [package] is $[price], you're live in 2 weeks, and I handle everything. What do you think? Ready to get started?"*
